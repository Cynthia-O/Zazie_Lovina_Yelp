0,Stacey P.,2019-03-09,5.0,"Thank you Yelp for recommending Lovina.

Myself and two friends were hungry, out of town visitors, and clueless where to eat. With such glowing reviews figured it was well worth the shot! I would not have found it otherwise because I must admit when we parked behind the restaurant and there was little signage and it looked like a house I was skeptical.

My skepticism melted upon entering and being warmly greeted immediately. It was just damn nice. We were seated promptly and our server was charming, welcoming, and just delightful. 

I ordered the cheeseburger, my friend ordered the cheese sandwich, and my other friend ordered the eggs and bacon. I was quite impressed when the orders came out. The portions are huge! That grilled cheese was the thickest, cheesiest sandwich I've ever seen. It ooooooozed cheese! The bread was hearty. It was just giant! My cheeseburger was also amazing - a perfect bun to meat ratio. It was oh so juicy, perfectly seasoned, fantastic cheese, and so very delicious. 

I was incredibly happy with our stop here! Highly recommend."
1,Cathy H.,2019-03-05,5.0,"Delicious local-feeling place! The daily focaccia (ours was dill) is amazing and the dipping sauce is super tasty too, with some good heat to it. The fried polenta bite appetizer is a must have with one of the best sauces I've ever eaten.

We shared the appetizers, a salad, entree and dessert and it was plenty of food for two. The green salad had a lovely, light crisp dressing with tasty pickled veggies.

For an entree we got the bolognese made dirty which is for sure the way to go. And dessert was a lemon tart with creme anglaise - rich and delicious!

The dining room has a nice cozy vibe that seems like it keeps people coming back; several tables seemed to be regulars, ordering without looking at the menu and catching up with the staff. We'll be back the next time we're in Calistoga, too!"
2,Himanshu K.,2018-11-24,5.0,"Amazing place

Definitely try the French Toast, the bread is amazing...everything is Very fresh and the place carries a nice vibe to it!

Its a first date place"
3,Sylvia E.,2019-03-02,5.0,"Little gem in Calistoga!  Delicious food and very attentive service.  One of the wineries we had visited recommended we try the cheese dip and it did not disappoint - super cheesy and full of flavor.  We also had the grilled cheese sandwich, Susie's remedy, duck and kale salad, and pork and beef bolognese pasta dish.  But have to say my favorite was dessert - the hot mess was amazing!  Brownie topped with pistachio ice cream, caramel sauce and toasted marshmallows."
4,Mary M.,2019-03-10,5.0,Great food and great service. The location is wonderful. We tried the cioppino it was so very good.  Will definitely come back here again.
5,Jim B.,2019-03-10,5.0,This was a real treat! We went for lunch and I had the best grilled cheese sandwich and best tomato soup ever! We tried all three appetizers of the day. They were all great! Service was top notch! Food was excellent! Chef even shared his winter vegetable kimchi recipe with us.
6,Nancy C.,2018-08-06,5.0,"Quick take: all day brunch spot


Love, love this cute spot! Super friendly and attentive staff. Indoor or outdoor dining is available. We ate at an off peak time so it wasn't crowded at all. 

Their menu looks delicious. We ordered 2 B.L.T.'s and a Susie's Remedy. Really good sandwiches and brunch food. 

A lot of special little touches in the decor. 

Highly recommend this spot!"
7,Jason S.,2018-08-09,5.0,"How is this spot only 4 stars? I constantly complain that finding a stellar brunch spot is nearly impossible. It's easy to find a good brunch place, but never an amazing one. But Lovina is the exception to the rule. Plus it's pretty darn affordable for the area. 

We tried multiple dishes and seriously all of them blew us away. The breakfast burrito with their house made salsa and duck fat fries was just killer. Seriously gonna be one of the highlights of the trip. The avocado toast with lox atop an everything-seeded crostini had unreal mouthfeel. The French toast was savory and sweet at the same time. Even the burger was perfectly tender. 

Stop by when coming through Calistoga, it can't disappoint."
8,Annie B.,2019-03-02,5.0,"Delicious brunch spot. Service was excellent and attentive. The highlight was the French toast. My partner remarked that is rare to have French toast be thick sliced, well soaked in custard and yet not be mushy.  Everything we ate was well done. Oh yeah don't forget to say yes to the duck fat potatoes. No good stories ever start with salad."
9,Susan C.,2018-05-28,5.0,"Absolutely excellent!  Stumbled, please do not think I really stumbled. But found Lovina simply because we were across the street at a Mexican restaurant and could not get served.  Memorial weekend in Calistoga is burdened with the fact they cannot get enough help to serve all who are partaking:)

We were incredibly luck to chose Lovina.  Great welcome and immediately seated outside on a lazy sunny Calistoga Sunday night.

Oh, the menu...my sister-in-law (German by birth) chose the spatzel and a dusting of red cabbage.Flavorful and comforting.  I had the risotto. Full of my favored veggies and creamy perfectly c"
10,Tom B.,2019-03-04,3.0,"I've been looking forward to dining here after the change from the very good Calistoga Kitchen but was not impressed. Three prawns in an  admittedly tasty cocktail sauce were followed by an over cheesed risotto. The cheese actually congealed on the plate as it cooled. My partner enjoyed her Chicken Tiki Yum Yum. However, the bread pudding was dry and the waitress volunteered to bring us a Hot Mess, which is appropriately named. I'll return for a second try and hope to update my review b"
11,Kat S.,2018-02-28,5.0,"Loved this place! We came here for breakfast Saturday morning around 10am and it was empty. People started pouring in after 11am. 

Very pretty, fresh, airy decor for cute photo ops. Vegetarian friendly. I had their French Toast and kimchi bread, and even I wasn't crazy about the bread, the french toast was amazing! 

Service was super-friendly and swift. I'd come back here for sure when next time in Calistoga!"
12,Derek C.,2018-12-04,5.0,Oh heavenly French Toast... thank you for your deliciousness. Please bless us with your presence once more.
13,Jeff A.,2019-02-10,5.0,"Taste is everything and Lovina's brunch did not disappoint.  Not a huge menu, but as the waitress said when the table next to me asked about specials; her response that every thing on the menu was special was accurate for us.  First the cocktails were special both ""Magic"" cocktail was amazing and the spin on the Mimosa was really refreshing.  The brunch we had included a wild mushroom poached egg with ricotta cheese on toast creation that the wife gives two thumbs up. My item sounds pedestrian, Breakfast burrito, but it was delicious as well.   This is a small place but the service was great.  Well done Lovina!"
14,Vivian D.,2018-10-12,4.0,"Maybe more of a 3.5 star experience, but for a small town restaurant, I think they are putting in the effort!  Our party of 6 got seated in the annex dining area (felt like we were a bit secluded, but interesting!) for Sunday brunch. I got the breakfast sandwich which was ok.  Breakfast burrito was actually not bad- and a bigger serving than the picture. They only serve a few potatoes however (quite odd). Overall, an alright time, service was decent, nice atmosphere for brunch."
15,Lee D.,2018-10-22,5.0,"My wife and I visited for a casual Sunday brunch and were very happy with the overall experience. The food was outstanding (get the Avocado toast), the bloody Mary's were flavored with an excellent spice, but not so much to burn your Sunday mouth off! The coffee was strong and plentiful and the service was excellent too.

You should visit."
16,Carnita M.,2018-09-09,4.0,"Really cute brunch spot, especially if you get a table out on their patio.  I was a bit worried because when I was walking up I heard one party talking about an insect landing on someone in their group, but luckily that wasn't really an issue for us.  Bees did buzz by a couple times, but flies were more of an issue - to be expected sitting outside imo and it wasn't as if we were swatting flies away the whole time.  Parking was easy for us the late Sunday morning when we went which was nice; we found a spot right in front when we pulled up.  As for the food, I enjoyed the breakfast burrito I ordered, which I asked for without salsa or sour cream and came with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and cheese - so good!  I chose mixed greens (instead of potatoes) with mine which I really liked also.  Portions are plentiful here so you will leave feeling satisfied.  To drink I had their Lovina Mimosa with sorbet which I found light and refreshing.  Lovina was my Plan B, as the restaurant I originally planned on going to was booked for a private event, but I'm really glad I came here because it ended up being a cute brunch spot with good food :)"
17,Joan S.,2018-04-27,5.0,"This was our absolute favorite dining experience on our weekend to Napa.
I am a huge foodie!  And let me tell you it is food perfection! The waitress was absolutely amazing! Her suggestions were perfect and showed she loved her job !
It was Easter Sunday and they had a cute ""Egg hunt""... chocolate foil covered eggs hidden all over the restaurant.  Anyone finding a gold egg got a $25 gift card.  Cute touch.
Most restaurants food and service suffer on holidays... not this one.
I love all the small touches like sparkling  or still water at no charge. As well as the glassware.
The food could not have been better!"
18,Mark P.,2019-01-26,4.0,"Walked in last Sunday at 5:45pm without a reservation.  It's a Sunday of a Holiday weekend, what could go wrong?  Nothing!  Jennifer greeted us and went out of her way to check the reservations that were already made.  If we could be done by 7pm we could sit at a table or have a seat at the bar which had about 6-8 open seats.  Sat at a table and had a wonderful evening.  The house made Polenta Bites were delicious and filling.   For dinner, I had the Pork &amp; Beef Bolognese and my wife had the Braised Lamb Shank.  Both were delicious!  Enjoyed the local Pinot Noir (only $8/glass) with both of our dinners.  No dessert, just didn't have room!  Will definitely be back again."
19,Cliff S.,2018-04-12,4.0,"My dad and I visited this nice modern restaurant in Calistoga.  It is a down stairs of a two story house.  We were seated right away on a Thursday night. 
My dad had the spicy Bolognese and I had the pork chop.
The noodles on the Bolognese were fresh with the beef and pork finely ground into a delicous sauce.
The pork chop wad cooked to perfection.
A nice place worth a visit."
40,Jessie B.,2018-10-20,5.0,"Favorite brunch I have ever been to. 

This place made me feel like I was in Stars Hollow at Luke's Diner! Everyone was so nice and it had the perfect small town feel. 

SUSIE'S REMEDY. You must get it. So amazing. Also the lemon bread pudding. 

Couldn't recommend more."
41,Patrick M.,2018-02-11,5.0,"Went here for brunch and came back later that night for dinner.
     
     For brunch I started with the Housemade Kimchi Bread which was yummy with a nice heat to it, and for my entree',  the Croque Lovina with a fried egg on top. What a tasty dish! The pork was perfect and the mushroom fondue was rich and creamy, perfect compliment to the cheddar cheese and foccacia bread. My friend had Cedar Street Breakfast, eggs over easy with bacon, breakfast potatoes, and mixed greens. She said the eggs were perfect and the potatoes were creamy and delicious. Service was great and very attentive.

     We returned for dinner around 8pm and the place was packed. We didn't make reservations and I would recommend that next time. Fortunately we were seated after a few minutes. We started with the Carne Asada Popcorn, which we saw at brunch but were more interested in the Kimchi Bread. The pop corn spice was delicious. I had the Spicy Pork &amp; Beef Bolognese and my friend had one of the specials, the 10 oz Berkshire Pork Porterhouse with tangelo &amp; carrot purée, vadouvan spiced cauliflower, celery root, lacinato kale. That pork dish was incredible, the flavors were fantastic.

I would definitely recommend checking out Lovina the next time you're in Calistoga. The food and service are great. Can't wait to see what they do next!"
42,Allison M.,2018-08-07,5.0,"Such a lovely gem of a restaurant. 

First of all, we love Calistoga.  It's still a bit hidden away to be overly-touristy (that will change, I'm sure), and has great little restaurants like Lovina.  

We came in twice for brunch and lingered to have some wine as well.  The menu is great, I definitely recommend visiting if you're in town."
43,Shigeo N.,2019-01-04,5.0,"Lovin' Lovina. We were staying at a five star down the road and wanted a ""regular diner"" breakfast. Lol. Their neon sign Lovina on Yelp and easy parking got me to the door. Got right in. First off, this is not a greasy diner. Its spotless. (I was a little disappointed because wherever I go I like trying the local greasy spoon ;-) 
The wait staff are efficient and friendly. Terrific breakfast. I had the Susie's Remedy and a great cup o joe. Healthy  and hearty. Clean fresh ingredients. I can't remember what anybody else ate because it is so delicious. I was yumming and ummming. I was in heaven with the great food and music. I dont know the history or owners...but it seems they ALL are happy and take pride in their cozy ""Diner"""
44,Eric M.,2018-07-13,5.0,"Stopped by for my wife's birthday, and they did an absolutely great job. Fantastic food, great presentation, and an outdoor patio that will knock your socks off.

This relatively new twist on an old favorite in Calistoga is definitely a must-see stop."
45,Maansi D.,2018-01-17,5.0,"Lovina was a tiny, gem of a find. Adorable little corner restaurant, the inside and outside of the restaurant were so charming. The food was absolutely delicious, such a pleasant surprise given we just happened to walk into this place. Nice relaxed atmosphere, perfect way to wrap up an overnight stay in this little town."
46,Daoud D.,2018-10-04,5.0,"I love it when a server is so confident in the food on the menu that it makes you just want to order everything, but very rarely do they get it right. Not Cassie, she absolutely won all of us over! It all started with the coffee, I normally only drink espresso but the coffee here surprised me in the best way. I don't want to detail every dish we had(they were all bomb af) but I need to mention two. The bolognese is why we will back but be sure to get it dirty. The French toast, as my dining companion put it ""is stupid good""! We will be back again and again. Love at first bite!!! Thanks Cass and crew @ Lovina."
47,A P.,2018-11-17,4.0,"We stopped in for lunch. My husband loved his BLT. The ""kimchi avocado"" was more accurate on the avocado than the kimchi. I know kimchi is very popular right now, but as a Korean person, I gotta call it when it's not really kimchi. This was still a fine dish, just ""kimchi adjacent sauce,"" to be more accurate. The squash and quinoa salad was nice. Service was friendly and prompt."
48,Ravindhran S.,2018-11-12,5.0,My wife and I visited here the past weekend. We ordered a egg dish with hasselback potato - mind blowing! Have never had brunch that tasted so good. Highly recommend the place. We chanced upon it.
49,Jay F.,2018-09-30,5.0,"Wonderful food, service and ambience! Steak was perfect and pre cut. Risotto was tender and flavorful. Pasta Bolognase was delicious. Wait staff very attentive. Enjoyed it a lot."
50,K S.,2018-12-02,5.0,"What a fantastic find!  Seemed like a good place to take a chance on a nice meal, and it was that and more!  Great service and wonderful, interesting dishes!  Will definitely go back!"
51,Lindsy S.,2018-07-29,5.0,Fabulous brunch! Highly recommend the Breakfast Burrito (w/o bacon) and the Avocado Toast! Our server Michaley was super helpful and attentive.
52,Aaron B.,2018-12-02,5.0,Wife and I had supper our first night and came back for brunch a couple of days later. Would definitely visit again the next time we are nearby. Great service and everyone is very friendly.
53,Laura G.,2019-02-07,4.0,"Very cozy setting, warm and friendly staff, interesting menu, very tasty food. But portions are small and prices are large. If you're okay with that, definitely try it."
54,Kaylene C.,2018-11-03,3.0,"Great atmosphere, wonderful service, mediocre food. We had the curry, chicken yum yum and the goat and beef bolognese. I recommend coming here for their yummy snacks."
55,Anne S.,2018-07-08,5.0,"Cute patio with friendly service. Great lunch stop when you're working you're way through wine country. 
If you're looking severely cheat on your diet, get the grill cheese!"
56,Samantha M.,2019-01-11,5.0,"Probably one of the best dinners I've ever had in Calistoga. Super small hole in the wall restaurant, located right on Lincoln Ave before you hit the main strip. The mushroom risotto was absolutely AMAZING, the New York strip steak was definitely something I'll come back for time and time again. The crispy mushroom polenta bites, I could not get enough of! Definitely make a reservation if you're coming on the weekend, it's totally worth it!"
57,Simon L.,2018-03-25,5.0,"Probably a 4.5.  Came here for brunch and tried the breakfast burrito.  It was massive and really delicious, primarily because of the unique salsa/hot sauce that gave it a really interesting kick.  Probably one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had."
58,Marina V.,2018-04-12,5.0,"My husband and I had our Valentine's dinner here when we stayed in Calistoga. Everything was delicious. We split a couple of soups, an appetizer (popcorn!), an entree and dessert. I was especially excited about chicken &amp; dumplings - yum! Everything is made with love and care, and the vibe was very nice. It's right on the main street in Calistoga, we walked around afterwards, it was a lovely evening!"
59,Shawn S.,2018-05-17,1.0,Check out the awesome mouth burn my girlfriend got from the tomato soup last weekend.  Sent Owner an email last Monday warning they are serving scalding food - no reply.
60,Ling L.,2018-10-02,3.0,"I was here for lunch during my trip to Napa valley area. I saw good reviews and stopped in for lunch. The food is okay, nothing to write home about. I think it's overpriced for what it is. But it sounds about right for the area."
61,Cindy S.,2017-08-20,5.0,"Loved this cute place. The Motown music made my whole morning as I danced through brunch.

You can order 3 different serving sizes of food! so brilliant, especially for kids.

We had:
Breakfast sandwich
Tiki chicken and poached egg focaccia 
1 slice of French toast- it was 1/2 slice of giant French toast with real vanilla bean whipped cream.
Everything spice ricotta - this is a must order!

Will come back. Thank you."
62,John A.,2018-03-07,5.0,"Our waitress was extremely helpful and sweet, brunch was excellent. Whole restaurant had a cool vibe reminded us of Luke's dinner from Gilmore girls. The service here is above and beyond, warm and friendly without being over bearing annoying and forced like some major chains where the waiters sit at your table while you order. (I hate that) 
this is honestly one of the coolest places in Calistoga to grab lunch, and will be the only place I visit for my next visits.

French toast is huge and delicious
Breakfast burrito was huge and also delicious
Coffee is pretty good and comes in funky mugs."
63,Sarah L.,2017-08-20,5.0,"I came across Calistoga Kitchen as I peeped around Yelp for somewhere to go with my girlfriends to celebrate a birthday.  With it's super cute retro signage, I had a feeling this was going to be the right spot for us and quickly made a reservation.

I was so happy to be right! I cannot rave enough about this place!  Not only was the food beyond delicious, but the staff... the staff! So warm and friendly with just enough sass to keep our little group giggly and happy.

But back to the food. With the 6 of us, we practically ordered every main entree on the menu: steak, chicken, opah (white fish), rabbit, and my personal favorite was probably the risotto. Each dish had beautiful flavors that we all enjoyed.  And the desserts!  Olive oil cake with strawberries and a hot chocolate cake... Orgasmic.

All night long, and into the next day we couldn't stop talking about our perfect meal at Calistoga Kitchen. I definitely want to go back to try their brunch menu, and then back the same night for dinner!"
64,Emily G.,2018-10-27,5.0,Visited here during our honeymoon trip to Calistoga.  Ate outside under the heat lamps in mid October and the temp was perfect.  Thoroughly enjoyed the pasta bolognese and the chicken tiki yum yum.
65,Jeff H.,2018-02-16,5.0,"Had an awesome meal here tonight!  Everything was great.  

The pork chop was amazing - on par with the Nopa pork chop which is our all time favorite.

The owner was there and chatted with us which was really nice.  Definitely a must visit while in Calistoga, which btw looks completely normal after the fire!"
66,Heather C.,2018-04-01,3.0,"Came here because of recent rave reviews. Sunday brunch. Very quaint and cute indoors and out. Outside dining is great. All the staff were very friendly.
Menu is good though expensive. $15 breakfast buttiro. $12 soup. $26 shrimp curry. $12 2 wggs combo.
I got the lemon chicken soup. It was fine but very creamy and sweet. I didn't eat 25% of the soup and the waitress didn't make any mention of ask if I enjoyed it, making me think she didn't notice or didn't care.
Husband got a $15 breakfast sandwich, it was good but not great.
Overall, disappointed with the food but the place itself is charming."
67,Kelly B.,2018-04-21,4.0,"Amazing breakfast. Just delightful and the outdoor garden dining was perfect. 

The breakfast sandwich on artisan English Muffin from Model bakery was mouthwatering."
68,Brandi S.,2018-09-16,5.0,"This is one of the best meals I've ever had. The risotto was amazing. I'll never shut up about it. Great service, cozy patio, and lovely vibes. Go here."
69,Jenn H.,2018-03-17,5.0,Wowsa! What a pleasant surprise. Fantastic and fresh food. I was blown away with the flavor combinations. A definite place to stop in Calistoga.
70,Maya L.,2018-12-27,5.0,Great little spot with home cooked style food! Very delicious and people who work there are nice.
71,Elizabeth S.,2016-12-10,4.0,"My fiance and I had just arrived in Calistoga to kick off our weekend and decided to have lunch here.  It's a very casual venue with low ceilings and a quaint, warm feeling of welcomeness.  Their unique menu items were not expected but quite gratifying!

He ordered a rib eye sandwich which he enjoyed.  I had to order their short rib bahn mi sandwich and of course the roasted duck soup.  How often do you see things like this on the menu??  I have to say both of these were amazing.  The roasted duck soup was like something I'd never tasted before- herby, a bit of lemon to compliment and of course the delicious taste of duck.  It was a hearty concoction.  The short rib bahn mi was like the most excellent Vietnamese sandwich!  -obviously not authentic but who cares...  It was great!  The short rib was pliable, juicy and flavorful- perfect with the red cabbage, julienned carrots and cilantro between two soft buns.  Everything hit the spot!

Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  She asked us how everything was.  It was an experience we'd happily repeat."
72,Angela B.,2018-09-08,5.0,"I do not understand how Lovina is only rated 4 stars. We ordered the French toast, a breakfast burrito, fried polenta and the Suzie's Remedy. It was easy to review this place because all 3 of us talked about how amazing the food was hours later. I got the last Suzie's of the day so make sure you get there before they run out. You won't regret getting up a little earlier. Everything was delicious and fresh!"
73,Karl K.,2018-09-01,5.0,"Excellent food &amp; good value compared to the other places in town. Enjoyed the hand made pasta with ragu, perfect and spicy. Had food envy the minute our orders arrived, the fish was so nicely presented &amp; I could almost hear the crispy pappadum crackling on the plate.  We usually choose a different restaurant for each night of our stay in Calistoga but by the end of the meal I found myself wishing that we didn't save this place for the last evening so we could enjoy this wonderful food one more time.  In a small town like this one you'll find that the restaurants are all doing pretty much similar variations of the same main ingredients &amp; it takes a very special place to stand out &amp; earn a place in a families collective memory.  I, my wife &amp; our daughter have nothing but praise for the outstanding meal we enjoyed"
74,Kate F.,2018-01-01,4.0,"Cute, quaint, totally Calistoga restaurant with good food. We visited here for a late lunch / brunch on a Saturday and they were out of quite a bit of stuff on the menu. We settled on the breakfast burrito and the grilled cheese sandwich with leek soup. A great way to warm up for lunch."
75,Liz S.,2018-09-15,5.0,"Loved Lovina sooo much we went two days in a row! Cucumber appetizer is incredible, BLT, gazpacho, burger -- best I ever had! A MUST go in Calistoga!"
76,Stephanie L.,2018-02-18,5.0,"Our best meal during a three day weekend trip to Calistoga! Lovina was better than our dinner at Sam's Social Club. Highly recommended if you're in wine country. 

Everything we had was absolutely delicious- the little gem salad was fresh, heritage pork chop was tender and super flavorful (and huge!), branzino perfectly cooked with crispy skin. Desserts were to die for! We had the hot mess and the bread pudding. We were so full but still finished both desserts. 

This restaurant has been under new ownership since fall 2017, and now has the same owner as Zazie, one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. We'll be back soon!"
77,Erica W.,2018-06-24,5.0,"The newly updated restaurant is SUCH an improvement, both in atmosphere and food. The patio is lovely, and offers great people-watching. Try the schnitzel, newly on the menu - it's HUGE and perfectly fried! All around, a great evening with excellent food and service."
78,Tim W.,2017-12-13,5.0,"I had the Roasted Delicata Squash Salad. The squash itself was yummy, perfectly matched with arugula and raisins. The vinaigrette was light and flavorful. 

I was ready to write off the ""Little Gems &amp; Avocado Salad"" as the necessary salad before the main, but wow, was I wrong. The greens were so fresh they tasted like they were picked that morning. The avocado was perfect, too. The occasional fried shallot piece was decadent. 

The main was the Roasted Mushroom Risotto.  I've had plenty of risotto in my life, but it's never been something to write home about. This was different. Wow. Easily the best risotto I've ever had in my life. We opted for the additional grilled chicken thighs; they were *perfect* - as good as the chicken at Zazie down in San Francisco. 

I didn't really have room for dessert, the Pumpkin Bread Pudding, but I managed to eat it all, anyways. And then I ate half of one of my friend's.

Service was top notch."
79,Mikey S.,2017-12-11,5.0,"I've been going to Calistoga for nearly 40 years and never had such a wonderful brunch as I did yesterday at Calistoga Kitchen. Employee owned with a sharp, friendly, efficient staff, I highly recommend coming here. It's right on the corner of Lincoln and Cedar, has an outdoor patio and various little rooms/alcoves inside. We were a large group so had a unique family style brunch made for us. New ownership and partners are really making this into a destination. I'm planning another trip soon just so I can eat here again. PS it's right next door to Calistoga Inn."
80,Terisa G.,2018-08-19,2.0,"The food was passable but the dinner service was quite poor. The food was a very long time in coming, with no updates. The appetizer was served with the entrees, some of which were no longer hot. The salmon was tasteless, as was the steak, so I'd avoid those two choices."
81,Shana M.,2018-01-18,4.0,"This was our best meal in Calistoga and everyone wished we could eat dinner here again. I'm a bit confused about the name as our reservation was for Calistoga Kitchen but it appears to be Lovina now? 

Made a reservation for a large group and they were really nice about us running a bit late due to unexpected traffic. My family are foodies ranging in age from 1 to 85 and everyone loved their meals. The only thing we were meh on was the kimchi bread. It was less flavorful than expected. All the entrees were good, but the risotto was especially delicious. I think we tried nearly every dessert on the menu and they were amazing enough that I would come here just for dessert. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and they accommodated a gluten allergy well. She was able to suggest wine options based on our descriptions of what we like and her pairings were spot on. 

The only low point was when a woman at the table asked how the branzino was prepared and the server instead seemed to assume that she didn't know what it was. She started here explanation with, ""Bran-zeeno is a fish"" speaking slowly. And went on to describe the fish in detail before finally telling us how it was cooked. As a group of mostly Black women, we typically get condescended to at one restaurant per trip to Napa Valley, a place with few African-Americans. Last time it was Solbar, this time it was this restaurant. But the food was good so we'll forgive them this time and will definitely be back."
82,Michelle B.,2018-01-14,5.0,"I went here for an early dinner with my boyfriend at an off hour and we had the place practically to ourselves, which was great. We had a spot by the window and had excellent service and absolutely delicious food. Their mushroom leek dip was AMAZING (I'm talking scraping the bottom of the plate amazing.) I ordered the branzino special and it was the perfect amount of crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. For dessert we shared the lemon white chocolate bread pudding, which was divine. Our server, Corryne, was excellent, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. Big props to her! The next time I'm in Calistoga, I'll definitely stop by again."
83,Mitch W.,2017-07-08,5.0,"Awesome home made food. Beautiful variety on menu. 
Had the Lamb Tagine. Simply delicious. Rick knows how to cook. He has been catering fine events in Napa Valley for years."
84,Gabrielle B.,2018-07-29,5.0,"Surprised at some of the poor reviews. My husband and I came on Sunday night and it was one of the best meals we've had in a long time!!! I never post reviews, and I had to--it was that awesome! Service was fabulous, food comparable, and we almost didn't come because of the mixed reviews. Please try them. I'm sure they won't disappoint; rather, they will awe you with how good the food is."
85,Sally R.,2018-05-29,5.0,"This is where to eat breakfast in Calistoga! And dinner's good too. Finally, solid brunch place in this gorgeous town. I ate at zazie constantly in my formative years so it was fun to try lovina but completely different."
86,Drew A.,2018-05-06,2.0,"I ate here when it was the Calistoga Kitchen before the ownership change. The new menu was confusing trying to be hip compared to the previous menu that had exceptional, consistently tasty food with wine pairings. The bread pudding was dry and lackluster compared to the previous menu that had rich chocolate ding dongs, a beautiful cheesecake, etc. which were all thoughtfully done. I was really hoping to like this because I came to the old one a lot. For now, there are better establishments in the region. I'm not sure why people try to do their own thing when the old thing worked well and kept a packed house every time I visited. Our waitress was a delight and made the experience better."
87,Julia G.,2018-07-06,5.0,"This is actually one of the 5 top meals I've ever had. Chef Jenna and her fiancé are unbelievable both at front of house and in the kitchen. I am blown away by the quality of food and service here. We started with the ricotta (house made), then the house smoked salmon and green salad, followed by risotto and the chicken tiki yum yum. My husband and I don't spend too much time seeking out the Michelin starred places or the hot new thing, we are drawn more to quality of food and ambiance without pretense. Lovina has it in spades. We could not be more grateful to enjoy this lovely restaurant in downtown Calistoga!"
88,Robin A.,2018-09-04,5.0,"Started with the homemade ricotta. Yum. Next, the most amazing heirloom salad (with burrata gelato!!!) we've ever tasted! My husband's strip steak was way better than he expected! He loved it! My prawn and tofu curry was flavorful, but it had too many potatoes (ask for mushrooms added), and could have been spicier. We had a lemon bread pudding which was so so good. Favorite meal in town."
89,Miles C.,2018-07-16,5.0,"I took my girlfriend here for our first date last week, on Friday night. We had an IMMACULATE experience. We started off with the chicken seasoned popcorn and polenta with an incredible aioli side, and were blown away. We decided to spring for a bottle of chardonnay at $50/bottle, and it felt like a steal. Buttery and balanced, we were very happy.

The salmon put our dining experience over the top. perfectly cooked, with awesome mussels and what I think was a garbanzo bean side garnish. 

Walked out of the door just under $200. Do not sleep on this place, you need to eat here. 

WE will be back. Thanks, Lovina staff!

-Miles &amp; Ashley"
90,E S.,2018-04-13,4.0,"Excellent salmon with white beans and warm kale salad. The staff was professional and ambiance homey. The only thing that would have made it better was the music-- the classic rock station just didn't seem to fit the organic, local vibe!"
91,Libby O.,2018-09-13,2.0,"Really, really, really (!) wanted to love this place, and had been reading the menu and reviews a week before our visit to figure out what I would get. I decided on the pork chop, and husband had the steak. We normally don't spend this much at a restaurant but were celebrating our anniversary so we thought we'd splurge. The steak was great and cooked perfectly. For the pork chop, I'm really wondering if they seared it and forgot to put it in the oven after, because it was totally slimy raw. I will even eat pork that is slightly pink in the center, because I think they determined you're allowed to do that now. But other than taking a few bites from the outside, I could not eat it. I are the panzanella on the side, which was tasty. I showed the raw pork to our server at the end of our meal, and all she said was ""I'm sorry about your undercooked pork"" ... here's your bill. Really disappointing. So timid old me had to ASK if there was any sort of deduction they could do since the meat was inedible. Eventually they took 20% off the bill, but I feel like good service would have been to wipe that entree from the check. Just such a bummer when you're really looking forward to a fancy meal out (without your toddler )"
92,Amy O.,2018-03-24,5.0,"Four of us had dinner here last night. It was outstanding. Pork chops was the runaway favorite, followed by the Bolognese pasta! Outstanding! We had too long to be served dinner, but proved worth the wait."
93,Pratham V.,2017-10-12,4.0,"I visited this place on a Weekend evening for dinner.
P.S: You must make a RESERVATION if you wish to visit this place on any weekend as we had to wait for nearly an hour to get our seats on the outside patio area.

Once we were seated, we ordered the following items:
1) Mixed Green Salad
The salad was fresh, ready to eat and tasty.

2) Spring Pasta
The pasta came with Alfredo Sauce.
It was a combination of pasta sauce, vegetables and some spices sprinkled on the top making it a very tasty dish.

Accepting the fact that they were trying vegetarian variant of the Pasta for the first time, it was too good to be their first attempt at this.

A Rose Wine was also ordered to complement the dinner and it was good too.

Overall this place is recommended for dinner as the outside sitting is very attractive with lights, lamps and other stuff.
The staff is extremely helpful and always smiling."
94,Héctor P.,2018-10-06,2.0,"Skip it. We went here for an anniversary dinner last night and although the food was edible, the wait for the entré was unbearable. We ordered 3 appetizers and we're going to share one New York steak between the two of us. The appetizers came fairly quick, 20 minutes. But that's where the trouble began. We waited an additional 50 minutes for the one steak plate to come out. That's 50 minutes AFTER we were done with the appetizers. It's hard to realize how long that is unless you're sitting there after repeated pronouncements that our food was coming. 30 minutes before the plate came our server said, ""your food is coming right out"". They offered us water we said yes. 20 minutes after that, I had to ask for the water since she didn't bring it. We've been coming to Calistoga for our anniversary for 21 years. This is the first and last time we eat here. If you're on the fence about this place, skip it. The food was unremarkable, the wait was unreasonable, and there are plenty of other places around. Oh, and no apologies offered at the end. Just the bill."
95,Barnali D.,2016-09-25,5.0,"We had a wonderful brunch here!  Tasty food, excellent service, and an inviting, casual setting.

My husband and I got two dishes and shared, one savory and one sweet.  The french toast was excellent - light, fluffy, and flavorful. The brisket hash was also packed with flavor.  We appreciated the fact that the dishes were innovative twists on traditional items.  

The service was truly standout!  The wait staff was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, patient and efficient.  We really felt well taken care of!

The setting is bright, inviting, and modern (but not ""overly"" so)!

An awesome spot for Sunday brunch - highly recommended!"
96,Christina S.,2018-10-14,5.0,"I was traveling with a friend to Napa to visit some wineries and see Calistoga and decided on stopping at Lovina for lunch.  What a wonderful find it was.  As soon as I stepped inside I liked what I saw.  It was comfortable, the sun was filling it with light, and the food smelled wonderful.  I ordered their BLT, and it was literally the best I ever had.  Served on sourdough bread, the bacon was perfectly cooked, and the tomatoes were heirloom and tasted like they were ripened on the vine.  Ending the meal with their dessert titled ""Let's Get Ready to Crumble"", it made our visit to Napa Valley a memorable pleasure.  I hope Lovina will be around for a very long time."
97,Adrienne R.,2018-01-31,4.0,I was pleasantly surprised by this meal! Me and my mom went for a mellow dinner on a Sunday night. They were playing fabulous music. The ambience is nice; it feels casual but still special. We had a delicata squash salad that was really delicious. Then we had a mushroom risotto that was very cheesy and delicious. Followed by an amazing ice cream sundae. Will definitely go back when in Calistoga!
98,Ryan R.,2018-04-29,5.0,Great service. Prime location. Delicious food. Easy parking.
99,Kate S.,2018-09-08,1.0,"For the record, I hate when people solely base their rating on the service, but I was so offended with Lovina's staff that I felt this was necessary. There were 4 employees talking amongst themselves and didn't acknowledge me as I walked in. Totally understandable if they were busy however the inside was empty and the patio was not full. When I chirped to see if anyone would look up, an employee replied, ""yes?"". I asked if there was a table available for my party. I let them know I was willing to wait and they replied ""okay, maybe we'll get something for you in a half hour."" I said ""okay, can I be put on the waiting list?"" Apprehensively she replied ""Sure"". I wonder if I would have received the same service if I was a different ethnicity."
100,Lance R.,2017-05-13,5.0,"This is hands-down our favorite restaurant in Calistoga.  Consistently excellent food in a setting that exudes casual elegance without feeling pretentious in the least.

Service is always friendly, professional, and appropriately paced.  Chef is usually out on the floor introducing himself and chatting with guests.  Prices are more-than-reasonable considering the location and the quality of food.

Not to be missed if you're in the area!"
101,Jeffrey H.,2016-05-07,1.0,"My black roommate and I came here for dinner without  reservation, I live in Napa and come for breakfast often

I am a white male, several guest FROWNED AT US, and the hostest Wanted to seat 3 WHITE WOMEN also without reservations IN FRONT OF US, and wanted US to wait 90 minutes for a tablle!

This is not a PROGRESSIVE RESTRAUNT, WARNING PEOPLE!"
102,Angela M.,2017-08-28,5.0,"Really cute and tiny restaurant in downtown Calistoga. Hours are limited. I visited with a friend and we sat outdoors at a patio with lots of umbrellas for shade. They didn't open until 9:30, which I feel is a little bit late, and within a few minutes of opening, the entire patio was full. Food and drinks were fresh and very good. My friend had French toast that she said was really great and I had chef Jenna's chicken tiki yum yum toast. The dish kind of looked like a mess on a plate, but was excellent. Service was extremely attentive, with constant check ins."
103,Sandra H.,2016-08-07,4.0,"Very good food and service. We had the Bolognese Pardella pasta, pork chop and rack of lamb. All were really good. A wide variety of wine to pair with the meal.
I would have given it 5 stars except that when it got crowded it was very hard to hear. They need shades on the windows too!!"
104,Paul E.,2018-07-28,5.0,"Omg the meat and pork pasta was the best meal I've ever had! Order it ""dirty"".  Amazing!"
105,Jim S.,2018-08-19,4.0,"Lovina is a small place in an old house, casual but with an upscale feel. Menu items are eclectic/inventive, but at least the ones we had were well executed and tasty. Service was excellent, prices were about as expected for the region."
106,Kurt S.,2017-05-13,1.0,"Good Luck!  What our hostess said as she pointed us to the door.  Some background:  We arrived on time with reservations made several days earlier.  The dining room was about 60% full.  We (wife and I) needed a table for two.  There were four obvious 2-person tables open, maybe more around the corner.  A few 4-person tables too were open.  She had one 2-person table that should not have been be a table.  It was placed between the front door, the bar, and the hostess station.  It was a really lousy table, unlike every other table in the restaurant.  The space should be used for a coat rack instead.  The hostess insisted on placing us in that horrible table, though we asked repeatedly for a different table.   Because the restaurant was fully booked through the evening she didn't care what we thought, and she made this loud and clear.

Apparently there were some other preferred customers, or who knows, maybe Donald Trump was on his way, and little people don't matter.  She had obvious problems with the computer table assignment system.  I'm not dropping $200 to $300 on a lousy dinner experience so decided to leave instead of taking that lousy table.  Her parting comment;  ""Good Luck!""

It's obvious this restaurant has become so full of itself it thinks it can get away with whatever behavior it wants.  A class act would have admitted their table problem and called another restaurant to get a table to help make things right.  I've noticed several other posts noting bad service and behavior at this restaurant.  There are many other restaurant options in Calistoga, try those first.  Nothing makes up for a cold dark table next to the dumpster."
107,A K.,2018-06-10,4.0,Excellent service! My friend and I shared the French Toast and I had the Breakfast Burrito and she had Susie's Remedy. The French Toast was delicious! My friend throughly enjoyed Susie's Remedy. Wish they had an espresso machine so we could've had lattes with our breakfast.
108,Jeanine B.,2018-07-23,5.0,"My husband and I went to Lovina last night for our anniversary. We enjoyed the best meal we had in years. We started with house made seeded focaccia bread (served with a chili oil) and deep fried mushroom polenta bites (both with a surprising twist). We both opted for the New York strip which was perfectly prepared and very high quality. It was served with a unique and savory salad. We paired our steak with a wonderful glass of Tempranillo from Six Sigma Ranch and Winery (Lake County). To finish our meal we opted for an amazing Fruit Crumble (blueberry, peaches, nectarines) served warm with gelato made from buffalo milk. It was obvious to us that innovation and creativity went into everything that was served to us. The  service we received was personable and professional. We couldn't have been happier. We look forward to going back for special meals in the future and just had to share our experience with the world."
109,Novlette S.,2017-12-24,5.0,Best Christmas Eve dinner! Everything we ordered was a hit! Staff was very friendly!!! Calistoga Kitchen is AWESOME!!
110,Alex B.,2016-02-21,4.0,"This review is specifically for their brunch experience. I enjoyed myself, and thought that the food was good. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to come to this spot on every occasion I'm in Calistoga. The menu for brunch is limited, and they only have 1 protein option for the omelette: bacon.

The highlights: 
French Toast: this was definitely the best part of my meal. Thick bread, yummy fruit and tasty overall.

Omelette of the day: it was tasty, but in my humble opinion, forgettable. It was a 16 dollar omelette that only had cheese, spinach and some bacon. I was slightly disappointed that there were no other meat option, like ham.

Overall, the food is tasty (though a bit pricy which is expected in Calistoga), the location is amazing, and it's worth a try. Certain items here are forgettable, but the French toast is great!"
111,Joe K.,2017-05-09,4.0,Nice and cozy place to eat before wine tasting. Most items were sandwiches. Everything was very fresh and the BLT sandwich I had was light with salad and heavy with real cut bacon. Very tasty and service was very good. Great place and experience for that wine country weekend.
112,Amy V.,2016-06-05,4.0,"Scott, our waiter was so energetic, attentive, accommodating and friendly!!! Pretty sure he opened the door for me at least twice. 

I got the burger that came with mixed greens. The burger bun was soft and crispy. Very good! Meat seemed juicy as well. They don't serve fries here which I thought was interesting but at least the salad made it seem a little healthy. 

Minus one star only because of the overall price. Nice and clean atmosphere though!"
113,Joanna M.,2018-05-01,5.0,"Love everything. The service was lovely. The food was mind-blowing. We changed our reservation online because my mom wanted a last-minute massage and they were totally accommodating and gave us a call to check in with us. We rolled in at 8:45 (the latest reservation you can get). Had a stunning pork chop. I had no idea what to expect from a tangelo &amp; carrot purée, but it was bursting with the flavor of spring and balanced out with Indian spices and the meatiness of the pork chop. Very different and I think better than mustard's chop (we had it the next day for a serious side by side to decide if it was the best pork chop of our lives. Spoiler alert: LOVINA WINS). Wasn't super hungry so I went with the Little Gems and Avocado Salad, thinking it would be just a salad. It was also stunning. Well balanced with a little jalepeno in the dressing, garlicy breadcrumbs, citrus, and avocado. It ticked all my boxes for a meal, and then some. No cocktails, which I sort of appreciate because it made it easier to choose a nice wine and I had a cocktail at Sam's Social Club earlier anyway. We loved it so much we went back for breakfast the next day. I love the flavors the chefs are favoring. They are really different than a lot of what I see in napa valley (typically asparagus salads, burrata and artichokes everywhere, and the inevitable fried brussel sprouts side). At brunch we got the snap peas little bite as a starter. Even that was amazing. They tossed the peas in lemon olive oil and had big flakes of salt, and it came with a grilled ramp aioli that was so great my mom was eating it with her fingers- citrusy, grilled, garlicky YUM. Not to mention the perfect french toast with thick, to-die-for fresh whipped cream, and prefectly cooked bacon. Very exciting. Can't wait to go back."
114,Ali G.,2017-10-12,5.0,"Pretty much the best BLT I've had (or at least in the top 3). The bacon was perfect, the bread was crispy, and the greens were delicious. I also ordered the gazpacho soup. So good! We had a big group and sat inside, but if it was cooler, we might have sat outside. It looked very nice!"
115,Michelangelo S.,2014-10-02,3.0,"A Bit Pricey, A Bit Scant, A Bit Bland, And That Might Be Okay, Because....

SITREP

...I'm probably not the demographic for this place.  The three (3) us of popped in here after 1pm after hitting a winery, and we were looking for something to sop up the wine already swishing around inside us.  

I'll tell you, though, who would love love LOVE this place!  My Grandparents.  The cuisine was right up their alley - no taste, no spice, no pizzazz, and rather bland - and so obviously suitable for their delicate digestion.

THE SETUP

Earlier along the way on our trek, we saw an In N' Out Burger, and we came THAT close to triggering those desires for a solid burger.  [And as I continue to outline this review, by the end we almost wish we had.]

But no.  We were in Napa Valley and we were bound &amp; determined to try something new, something more in line with the elegance of this area, and not so ...uh..  ""pedestrian"", if you take my meaning.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

The staff were proficient, friendly, and a major credit to their restaurant.  From the hostess, the server, the 2nd server, they were on top of it the whole time, and they are the reason why this rated experience is at 3-stars and not lower.  The one thing we did not skimp on was the tip, since THEY deserved it. 

LE MENU

Fabi went for the Heirloom Tomato &amp; Mozzarella Omelet.  I almost did too, but Brian and I both pulled the triggered instead on their Steak Hash.  It looked promising.  And I can honestly say in any event that it was averagely good.  Not bad at all.

But it lacked taste, it lacked flavor, it lacked pizzazz.  I also found the portion to be considerably small, and rather pricey at the $15 price point.  

LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION

However, we were not in Sacramento where the exact same category item would be $10 at the Fox &amp; Goose - nor were we in Glendale where the exact same category item would be $8 at Jeremy's.   After all,  ""This is SPARTA!""  (Or rather, Calistoga).  And there always seems to be an attendant cost along with locational-ego. 

In the end, I wish I HAD gone with my ""gut"" feeling (for my ""gut"", you see), and that we had just stopped at In N' Out Burger while we had the chance.  It would have been much more satisfying, filling, and only for a 1/3 of the cost.

THE LOWDOWN

Sometimes you believe you need to give a ""new thing"" a shot, to try something different, while you are in a new location, for a new experience.  Just recognize the fact that sometimes it doesn't always pan out as the most rewarding new experience you are hoping for."
116,Soyoung P.,2016-05-21,5.0,"We got a perfect risotto here today! Had Duck soup and Arugula salad before risotto, and literally every dishes were completely emptied not because we were hungry, but because the dishes were so good and their recommendation of wine was so pleasant! 
Will be back for brunch tomorrow!"
117,Dawn S.,2017-10-08,5.0,"Fine dining with a hometown feel. We made reservations, recommended, and arrived a little earlier than expected. We were seated right away. I think we are fairly typical of the kinds of people that visit the Napa Valley. We aren't real wine snobs, but we know what flavors please us and we like a good meal that we wouldn't want to fix at home. The Calistoga Kitchen fit both of our needs. We started with a bottle of ""shiner"" or bottle without a label supplied by a local winery. It was a cabernet/zinfandel blend that was delicious with our appetizer and meal. We got the feeling that the menu changes seasonally, which for us is great. I love tasting seasonal foods in new and exciting ways. We had peaches and cream on delicious bread with a sweet chili citrus sauce that made the warmed peach sweetness pop (see photo). Dinner was great. It was their seasonal special so suffice it to say that it was delicious and I would venture to guess that the chef knows how to put flavors together that are both interesting and satisfying. Now the dessert seems like it was a staple; a pot of chocolate with marshmallows that have been browned a little, rich and decadent (see photo). We enjoyed our time here very much. We were very happy that we had walked from our hotel so we could walk back in a leisurely manner through the lovely town of Calistoga; enjoying our satisfied bellies."
118,Willyne W.,2017-10-28,5.0,The food here is wonderful. The flavors dance on your taste buds. If you are ever in town you must eat here!!
119,Lewis S.,2018-01-02,5.0,"Had a great meal with a group of friends New Years weekend. The place was busy but the staff was quick, friendly, and thoughtful. The food? Fantastic! Great selection of wine (naturally, it's in wine country) and beers too. Everyone had a lovely time and a great meal. What else could you ask for?"
120,Chesa C.,2015-12-13,5.0,"The gem of Calistoga! Don't settle for the pretentious overpriced places in the area; this place is the real thing.
First came here two years ago after my partner ran the half marathon. The duck soup stuck with me that day so I knew we'd have to come back.
 After all these years, the duck soup is still unforgettable, as were all the dinner dishes we ordered (lamb shank and roasted chicken). Dinner was so good we came back for brunch the next day. The smoked salmon on the latke was phenomenal. The rib eye hash was loaded with tasty veggies though it could have used a bit more rib eye. The French toast is pretty decadent.

The service is amazing! Chef Rick comes out to check on you and pastry chef/server Scott is a riot (not to mention a great pastry chef)."
121,Alicia K.,2017-04-20,5.0,"We were recommended by a local to come here for the ""love in the food coming from the kitchen.""  And she was right!  Great service, great atmosphere, great patio to enjoy a gorgeous day and incredible food. Delicious salad, rack of lamb and  bolognese. Don't miss out!"
122,Daniel C.,2017-09-19,5.0,Put wrong review here . My apologies. The food looks lovely lol. Saw the pictures and although didnt get to try it looks great .
123,Allison W.,2018-05-19,5.0,Fantastic brunch.  The toast with poached egg and mushrooms was the best!  Loved the atmosphere as well.  Great place for a morning coffee on the patio!

125,Jill G.,2017-08-29,4.0,"I went here for breakfast with some of girl friends. This place is super cute and all the girls loved their food. Unfortunately, I was super hungover so I can't speak to much...All I can say is, the sourdough toast I tried to eat was really yummy. The Bloody Mary was good and spicy, just the way I like it. And the bathroom was so nice nice and clean I that I visited it 2 times (cause I was hungover...sorry.)"
126,Stephanie J.,2018-05-26,3.0,"We were really excited to try Lovina as we love Zazzie in SF and would go all the time when we lived there. We went for breakfast and it wasn't too busy, which was nice, but they had no one working the front so had to wait and have a few servers walk by without acknowledging us for the first five minutes. Finally someone at the bar came up and sat us outside. The outdoor patio is really pretty and great ambiance. The food was subpar though :/ they were out of breakfast potatoes so my husband and I both went with mixed greens as our side dish for our breakfast. There was a dead insect in my salad unfortunately which I understand happens, means it's fresh lettuce! But still, not appetizing. I told the waitress quietly and she said sorry but didn't offer to bring a new salad or anything... probably won't be going back any time soon."
127,Anne Parker J.,2017-05-01,5.0,"On our way to Six Sigma Ranch in Clearlake for a high school mountain biking race, we decided to stop in Calistoga to grab some food. 
Haven't done any research ahead of time we decided to follow our instinct, and with a little bit of help from Yelp, discovered this gem of a restaurant. 
We read the menu before entering and found about 8 or 9 items that were appealing to us at that time. 
We settled for the quail salad (delicious), the duck soup (tasty), the black cod (aka. butter fish or sable fish, outstanding!!!)
Dessert was very good if lacking a bit in presentation (blob), but since we are pastry-chefs, our standards are above average:)
Next time we are in the region, we'll definitely come back!!"
128,Lori O.,2017-07-07,3.0,"We ended up waiting about 5 minutes in the entry way for someone to help us. Finally a waitress let us know a hostess will be right with us. We sat outside which is what we asked for as the Calistoga nights are absolutely perfect. The waitress finally came over and we ordered our appetizers and cocktails and we thought we were off to a good start. We get our app prior to the drinks which is not ideal but ok. We then proceed to order and the waitress lets us know that they are out of bolognese and salmon, which was our first two choices. Bummer. So we took another minute and ordered the duck and rabbits which both were good just would not order again. Disappointing due to all the good reviews, I definetely expected more."
129,Diana S.,2018-04-24,1.0,"HORRIBLE SERVICE! We were there on Sunday for lunch. The waitress had an attitude (maybe having a bad day?) Got food on table and had to ask several times for utensils to eat. :( Utensils came... no napkins. Asked for those and got eye roll. Ordered lemonade, didn't come until AFTER the meal when I asked about it. No apologies for any of the mistakes. Food underwhelming. The punch in the face: my kids have severe allergies so brought a baby watermelon (for desert) just for the kids. Asked for knife to cut... they can let you do that. Ok, I understand. When I asked them to cut it, they said $8 to cut it!!!!!! Thats just messed up! (Was NOT trying to avoid getting from them) There are PLENTY of better choices for food and service in that area."
130,HOLLY P.,2015-08-01,4.0,"Lovely sitting outside for dinner.  My BF had the roast duck soup.  Really really tasty.  Made with roast duck bones to make the broth.  Very good.  I had a beautiful arugula and beet salad.  Delicious and light.  Customer service is friendly and professional. I had the chicken breast, which was so good with the mushroom sauce and my BF had the duck with cherry reduction.  He thought it was juicy and cooked perfectly, medium rare, but wished the skin was a bit crisper."
131,Amanda C.,2016-07-06,4.0,"Came here with a reservation for breakfast since we didn't know how busy it would get on a July 4th weekend - got seated immediately with lots of seats inside and outside of the restaurant. We opted to sit inside and ordered their housemade lemonade - it was a bit on the sour side so I added my own sugar. I had the salmon salad and my boyfriend had the omelette of the day. My salmon salad was delicious with smoked salmon (a little on the saltier end, but eating it with the veggies help a lot), avocado, and deliciously sweet cherry tomatoes. My boyfriends truffle mushroom omelette was also delicious and you could taste the truffle very well. His also came with potatoes, yum! The chef later came to ask how our food was, which was a nice gesture of the restaurant to truly care for the customers' feedback. Definitely a nice breakfast spot in Calistoga :)"
132,Claudia A.,2017-08-27,5.0,"Adorable restaurant in an old home right on Lincoln. Charming outdoor patio enclosed with a white picket fence. Jennifer Bennett, owner of the amazing Zazie in San Francisco, is now at the helm and the food is delicious! Went for brunch and the pâté, fish, and burger were a hit. Homemade pickles and bun on the burger, fish was cooked perfectly with a delicious umami sauce, and the wonderful pâté came in a small mason jar with pickled onions and toasts. Super friendly staff took care of us."
133,Daphne G.,2017-09-21,5.0,"My husband &amp; I were on our way to our mud baths in Calistoga. We stopped here for brunch beforehand &amp; were blown away. The Baked House-Made ""Everything"" Ricotta was delish, served on their homemade focaccia bread. I had the Cedar Street Breakfast with the potatoes that were excellent combined with red peppers. But, let's talk bacon ... my bacon was thick-cut &amp; cooked PERFECTLY. Not your regular 2 pieces either, but 3. It was probably the best bacon I've had at a restaurant. My hubby had the breakfast sandwich that he had to eat with a fork because it was piled high with bacon, eggs, cheese &amp; tomato. He also had the house-made lemonade, which was super fresh sweetened with agave nectar. Eat here if you're in the area!"
134,Jade T.,2015-05-12,5.0,"A delicious, brilliantly cooked meal in a beautiful and charming setting. 

ATMOSPHERE- This place is adorable inside and out. The patio is irresistible with its charming tables and abundant foliage. One of my favorite restaurant patios in Napa Valley area. 

FOOD- excellent! The chef here is a genius. Not only are the flavors a perfect synergy, but the food is cooked masterfully. We shared the arugula and goat cheese salad, which was amazing. Though be warned its the very long and narrow form of arugula, that reminded me of frisée. (Check out the photo I posted of it). The presentation is lovely. I had the duck with sour cherries, cooked medium. There was no raw interior like you often get with duck breast; it was evenly cooked yet bursting with juice. And the sauce complimented the duck rather than masking it. There was a delicious sweet potato purée, which was lightly sweet from its natural goodness rather than the candied, saccharine variety served at most places. My husband had the pork chop, which was generous in size and flavor. 

SERVICE- all the servers and bussers were very nice, helpful and deferential. 

Can't wait to go back and try something else (they change their menu regularly)!"
135,Kelly F.,2017-08-27,5.0,Had breakfast here and the food was so delicious that we wish we were staying longer so that we could have lunch and dinner here. The produce is incredibly fresh!!!
136,Vida D.,2017-08-20,4.0,"Loved everything about our visit. Friendly staff, and a great, seasonal menu. Seating is either on the cute garden patio or in the cozy interior space...both are perfect for a date or group dinner. Everything on the menu looked and tasted incredible. We really enjoyed our experience...looking forward to our next visit!"
137,Cynthia O.,2018-01-02,5.0,"Love this place! My family and I recently enjoyed a great dinner here. Our favorites included the little gems salad (amaaaazing punchy buttermilk dressing), the bronzini with fire-roasted tomatoes and an assortment of lesser sea creatures, some really stunning roasted heirloom pork chops, and of course Zazie's signature baked hot chocolate. The service and atmosphere were both excellent, and the pineapple guavas in the parking lot were a thoughtful add-on. More restaurants should landscape with exotic fruit."
138,Stewart E.,2016-05-09,5.0,"Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. We shared the House made granola with yogurt,
French toast, with a side of eggs and bacon. Plenty of food for 2. The French toast was at least an inch thick and so yummy. It wasn't too sugary and had cinnamon and walnuts in it. They also had fresh squeezed orange juice. Staff was very nice. The head chef visited our table and was very nice and funny too."
139,Faith A.,2017-05-28,2.0,"Charming garden seating and good salad and bread, but if you're going to talk me into spending $18.00 on a tuna sandwich (#okaymybad), even after I warn you I'm a flavor-forward girl, it damn well better come as advertised. And when the capers and Kalamata olives are nowhere to be found, you might want to comp the whole tasting-like-canned, mayo-y mess. #evenneedssalt #epicwaitressingfail #gimmemy20 #wherestheleadership #cryinginmycar"
140,Jay E.,2016-04-30,5.0,"From the minute we entered we were treated as valued customers. Inside or outside? Both were available tonight. It was a little cool and no heaters, so we chose inside. My sweetie ordered a glass of Pinot Noir. It was nice.

I ordered the Chicken w/ Risotto and she had the locally caught Sole with mushrooms and vegetables. Both dishes were exceptional. Chicken was done to perfection. I got a taste of the Sole, and the sauce was delicious.

Our waiter was really nice and just the right amount of attention.

We had a dessert of Coconut Tapioca with Sorbet. Very light and not too sweet.

I was hoping for an Espresso, but they only had drip coffee. No problem. The coffee was good.

A few notes:
- Inside was slightly noisy from loud talking customers next to us.
- Well-behaved dogs are welcome on the patio

Overall experience was excellent!"
141,Cathy W.,2016-03-26,5.0,"Our niece was visiting from Portland, Or. so my sister and I took her on a Napa Valley tour. We were in Calistoga at lunch time, and came upon this quaint little Cafe. The patio beckoned us to come in! The menu is totally filled with healthy choices. If your looking for a a burger, they offer one but no fries. Wonderful salad choices too! I had the Chicken Buen Mi sandwich. A delicious grilled thigh, served on a Brioche Bun with all sorts of greens and thin slices of Sriracha peppers. My sister and niece chose salads and added a grilled chicken breast as well. The cute patio area was a perfect place on a beautiful day. Our waiter was a sweetheart as well. He even surprised us with a complementary dessert of a  Flourless Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream! The chef even mingled from time to time with us, making sure we were satisfied with our meal!! If your looking for a special dining experience, I recommend The Calistoga Kitchen!"
142,Natasha K.,2017-07-25,5.0,"This place is fantastic! Went here on the last day of our weekend in Calistoga, and have decided that this will definitely be our go-to place when we come back. The staff is SO friendly and the service is speedy. The food was delicious, without the pretentious price-point of most the other restaurants in the area. The restaurant has a really cute, quaint atmosphere with a pretty outdoor dining area. Definitely recommend!"
143,Amuse B.,2017-03-30,5.0,This was recommended by many of the locals we met and we weren't disappointed. We ordered off the specials menu ad our meals were delicious. $15 corkage which is a deal.
144,Kate C.,2017-11-07,5.0,"What a fantastic spot! Was just up this past weekend in Calistoga staying around the corner and came here for dinner Saturday night, then late brunch the next day! The food is both creative and comfortable. Nothing pretentious here, just fresh local ingredients and a lotta love. There wasn't one thing that we didn't think was great, but highlights were: the ""everything"" ricotta which was phenomenal, and I recommend asking for it with a big spoon; the cavatelli goat bolognese (which was a special, but hopefully they'll have it again, or something similar) has changed all my previously-held feelings about goat meat...and bolognese....and cavatelli - spicey yet not too heavy, thanks to the delicate house-made cavatelli; the bavette steak was perfectly prepared and tasty enough for me, not the biggest steak fan, to have more than a few bites (much to my husband's chagrin); finally, the chicken &amp; dumplings will CHANGE YOUR LIFE. It's basically a hearty chicken soup with dumplings in it, but the flavors and textures are rich and perfectly balanced, and the dumplings are soft little heaven pillows, while the whole thing will fill you up without weighing you down. I recommend adding one of the house-made hot sauces/salsas if you're a fan of that kind of thing. I did for a few bites and was not disappointed. Ambiance is warm and inviting, the staff is friendly and helpful and attentive without hovering. They really want you to enjoy yourself, and you do! It feels good being there and I am really looking forward to going back!"
145,Katie M.,2015-03-08,5.0,"Great service. Amazing food that was in my top 10 restaurants ever. Scallops were cooked perfectly and use of truffle oil perfection. The chef came out and personally checked in with every table. Great menu selection, Quick service and adorable place. I kept going on about how amazing it was (which apparently gets annoying to your date...the only downside). Hands down, this is a winner and I can't wait to come back."
146,Charlie D.,2016-02-21,4.0,"Omg! The French toast is amazing! Crunchy on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside! It's horribly guilty but worth going to hell for it. The duck hash was pretty good too...though the French toast stole the show. Definitely coming back for round II"
147,Susie R.,2015-04-08,4.0,"It's difficult to give stars since we didn't eat here BUT we must give the chef kudos.  We heard they have the BEST BLTs so we stopped on our way through Calistoga.  Unfortunately the restaurant wasn't open today (a Wednesday).  The chef spotted us through the door, though, and came out to speak with us.  He gave us several recommendations for local dining and we ended up at a amazing place for lunch.

Thank you, chef Rick Warkel, for being so hospitable.  We hope to make it back to your restaurant sometime to sample your work."
148,Karina C.,2017-03-19,4.0,"Before sharing everything that was great about this restaurant I want to address the one critique I have about their service which seems to be all too common anymore and right off the bat can send patrons into a negative state. It is also something if addressed can have the opposite effect. We had made dinner reservations through Open Table and when we arrived on time, most of the two tops were still empty, however the hostess led us to one of the worst tables close to the kitchen. When I asked whether we could sit at one of the other more desirable tables she told us that they were trying to turn over tables fast that night and could not accommodate that request. I was not really sure how that explained her decision but we went ahead and had dinner at the assigned table. We noticed throughout our 1.5hr dinner that those other tables did not fill up but she had also declined other patrons request for a certain table and even sat a couple outside rather than give them an available table inside. By the time we left there was still the same table available we had requested earlier. We clearly felt that we were not considered as valued as guests as others. The easiest thing for hosts is to seat guests at the best available table at the time. This way everyone feels welcome and later guests understand that the best tables might be gone by then.
Our dinner otherwise was lovely. I had the duck breast which was cooked to a perfect medium temperature and was accompanied by the best snap peas and sweet potato purée. The cherry glaze topped it off for perfection. My husband had the crab filled tortellini special in a saffron fish stock, which reminded us of a Boullabaise and was delicious. Service, aside from the hostess', was impeccable. The timing of the courses was done perfectly and our lovely server was knowledgeable and attentive. 
I would have given this experience 5 stars had the hostess been more welcoming."
149,Emma B.,2017-04-10,5.0,I've had two dinner meals here and really enjoyed both. We had reservations both times. Also - the desserts are so good! I think I like them better than the dinner meals. I'd like to come back on a warm day and sit outside.
150,Rita H.,2014-10-04,2.0,"My husband and I were wandering around Lincoln around 8pm on a Thursday night looking for any food that is fast and edible.  We walked in to Calistoga Kitchen without a reservation, and they told us we can eat at the bar if we don't want to wait for a table.  Sounds good, but that's pretty much where the pleasantries end.

The service is slightly below average.  We waited 15 mins after sitting down for someone to realize we exist, despite the fact that the bar is right in front of the kitchen, and where ALL servers and the hostess return to like a hive or mothership.  We were hoping to order when we got our waters, but I think the waitress sensed that, so she poured the water and hightailed it out of there.  We waited another 8 minutes before another waitress came by to take our order.  At least our food came at a reasonable time, but at the end it took forever to get our bill and get out of there.  Ugh, don't know why they gave us terrible service and then refused to put us out of our misery sooner.

Here's the best part.  We ordered our overpriced ""ribeye"" and it didn't taste like one.  The meat was bland and tough and lacked any marbling.  And they left us a present, the same way your cat bestows upon you a fresh bird carcass on your living room floor.  The ""ribeye"" was still wrapped in the elastic cord that was used during storing or cooking or something, my husband almost choked on it.  I have included a picture.  Of the cord, not the choking.  Overall it was the most disappointing $45 ever.

Oh we also ordered a starter of bread and olive oil because we foolishly thought it would be a shared appetizer.  When 3 thumb-sized slices of bread arrived, we couldn't stop laughing.

TL;DNR:  Service was slow, food not great and a choking hazard, and overpriced, don't get the ""ribeye""."
151,Ken W.,2016-02-14,3.0,"Limited brunch/lunch menu, food taste is average and so is the service. Cute garden type dining outside but the overall experience is unremarkable. Prices are reasonable, parking can be a challenge. Overall, a ho hum dining experience."
152,Klaus C.,2017-05-28,4.0,"We visited Calistoga Kitchen 27 May 2017 for the first time. What made us book a table there in the first place was Chef Rick - the evening before we were checking out the dining scene and Chef Rick came out personally to greet us and explained us about the specials on his menu - Manilla clams in an exquisite chorizo broth was the one that got me hooked for the following evening.
Again, as we came in for our reservation, chef Rick was so personable making sure that we were comfortable - in general a great staff who create such a homey atmosphere. 
We kicked off with the House cured salmon on a potato cake - amazingly crisp combo that also include horse radish and hard boiled egg in the middle. For mains, we went for the Manilla Clams and the Spring Risotto - the clams excellent and the chorizo broth w really good spice and acidity levels. The risotto kept surprisingly light, and very fresh mushrooms.
The staff's wine suggestions were terrific.
Can't wait to visit again!!!"
153,Tina R.,2016-02-28,5.0,"The food here is SO DELICIOUS!! The portions may be small for their price, but it was totally worth it! I had steak and eggs and it also came with potatoes and toast. Everything on my plate was cooked to order. My steak was medium and my eggs sunny side up just the way I wanted them. I've never had such great steak like this before. I don't even know why I asked for ketchup because I ended up not using it in the end. That's how tender and tasty the steak was by itself! LOVEEE LOVEE LOVVEEE! If I'm ever in Calistoga or anywhere North in Napa again, I'll definitely come by here for brunch! Oh, did I mention that the people who work here are so nice and friendly? Yup!"
154,David M.,2017-12-11,5.0,"We came in on a Saturday evening during the off-season.  After looking at most every menu in Calistoga, we came in expecting three stars and hoping for four stars.  Instead it was a solid five stars, far exceeding our hopes.  The food was great, and the service was friendly and accommodating.  The wine list was limited but good and well-priced.  We told everyone we met in Napa Valley the next day about our find.  We'll gladly be back!"
155,Diane Z.,2016-06-06,5.0,"Let them know we were in a rush, so they did everything they could to get us in and out!!! Awesome service. Awesome workers. Greatly appreciated! Going back every time we go to Calistoga! Oh and food was great!!!!"
156,Events i.,2017-03-12,4.0,Duck lettuce wraps are a must have the service was great and the steak was delicious and flavorful.
157,Greg P.,2017-10-31,1.0,"We visit Calistoga every year in October so this time we thought we'd try the Calistoga Kitchen.  Unfortunately they neglected to mention on their website that October is their ""Goatober"" month.  (Seriously, that's what the menu said.)  The menu had two goat entrees, Pork T-bone, no beef or seafood of any kind, unless you count shrimp.  Stayed for an appetizer.  Overall pretty lacking.  There are better restaurants in the area with more variety."
158,Tori C.,2015-09-10,1.0,"At first, I had such negative thoughts about this restaurant, I knew I had to wait a while to post my review so it didn't come off too harsh. Where do I begin.....
1. The waiter was high and couldn't for the life of him, figure out our order. 
2. He gave my boyfriend his dish and it wasn't until after he started eating, that he came back over, told him it wasn't his dish and placed it in front of someone else in our party. 
3. The food is way over priced for the portion
4. The restaurant has a sterile feel to it.
5. I had to go home and eat dinner after I left that dinner. That's how small the portions were and how unsatisfying the meal was."
159,Michelle S.,2015-10-06,5.0,"Came her on a Sunday with a girlfriend, and this place didn't disappoint. We both ordered the rabbit stew which was fresh, surprisingly light, and incredibly delicious. I also ordered the pear and turnip salad which was fantastic. All their food is farm to table, making it seasonally fresh, healthy and unique. Will definitely come back!"
160,Jaleh N.,2016-11-20,5.0,"We had the best experience here on a girls getaway trip. First an amazing dinner with great service and nice conversations with the chef and followed by brunch the next day with the best French toast any of us had ever had. Also loved the cowboy steak, the lamb, brisket hash. Will definitely go back there every time in town."
161,John P.,2016-09-24,1.0,"We sat here for almost an hour before our food was served.  Party that was seated 1 minute before us got their food and left before our first dish arrived, and the party that came after got their food before us.  Seems like a cute place but we sipped on 4 glasses of water waiting, so something was awry or we just got the classless treatment"
162,Joseph M.,2017-02-19,5.0,We went for dinner and the service was excellent. The food was even better than the service. A little pricey but well worth it.
163,Bob B.,2015-06-25,5.0,"Smoked salmon salad was perfect. Most people cannot smoke salmon without overcooking it. Here they know what they're doing.

They have a nice indoors dining area but an ample front patio if the weather is good"
164,Polina K.,2015-06-21,1.0,"We came in (party of 6) at 10am and the place was half empty. The host was not friendly and said that there are A LOT of reservations and we had to wait for 40 minutes. Totally understandable. We went for a walk, came in to check - now the wait is an hour ! Apparently, the kitchen was running behind. Reallly ? There were 5 tables. 
We left our phone number and name and expected a call. Never happened! Very disappointed."
165,Dina W.,2016-06-23,5.0,Great place for a medium size group. Amazing outdoor seating. Great drinks and noshes.
166,Stan B.,2016-11-19,4.0,"Really ought to be 4 1/2 stars... Wonderful dinner tonight... Warm spinach and goat cheese salad with walnuts, a perfect vinegarette dressing ... Swordfish with brocollini, summer squash and forbidden rice...along with lamb tortellini... Everything prepared to perfection... Great staff... The short wine list is, in Napa Valley terms, almost under priced!!! A small cozy must return to bistro..."
167,Jessica J.,2016-08-20,1.0,"Totally a bummer... We arrived 7 minutes early and met a kurt waitress who noted we were early. When I asked to be seated outdoors, she refused, despite the 8 available tables. Her lack of flexibility and inability to offer an alternative option pushed us to walk out the door to another one of the many cool spots on Lincoln Street. While we were walking out she said... ""Well if you don't want to have great food, you can go."" Rude!"
168,Montinique I.,2015-07-03,5.0,"By far the best short ribs I've tasted in a really long time!!! The sauces, the mac n cheese, cole slaw, and baked beans all HOUSE MADE. Every ingredient super fresh.  The plating...just beautiful. The ambience is lovely. They've earned 5 stars from me, and I wish it could be 10!!! It was well worth the price ($18) and well worth the wait. Huge shout out to our host Scott for being super nice and also huge shout out to Rick the man who personally came out to seek out our opinion and told us a few ingredients used. Very well done!"
169,Alison S.,2016-12-12,5.0,"We had a fantastic experience here and would highly recommend! We were having a girls weekend in Calistoga and came across this treasure by accident. We were looking at the menu just outside the door making our decision when we were greeted by the owner and ushered in.  Our server was so sweet and gave us some excellent suggestions on what to and where to go.  The food was delicious and so fresh! 

Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good place to eat in Calistoga!"
170,Petey G.,2016-05-15,5.0,Wish we could give this place more stars. This is probably the best place to eat in Calistoga. The food is consistently outstanding. Portions are always generous. Delicious wine list. Gorgeous setting. Staff is professional yet extremely personable and friendly. The chef/owner Rick really cares about your dining experience. We often see him in the front talking with the guests. This is a MUST when you are in Napa Valley.
171,Dean A.,2013-08-23,5.0,"Great meal tonight!!!! New local restaurant using farm to table concept. The Hanger steak was OFF the charts! The service was above ""the best"". 

I'm sitting in the bar and watching the dedicated employees take walk-in 3 mins before they close and 1 minute after they close. 

The executive Chief and Owner is dedicated to make sure each customer not only gets the best meal, but the service is incredible!!!!"
172,June Y.,2015-04-21,3.0,"This place had so many elements that I love in a restaurant. Quaint, cottage-style, reasonable prices, and the promise of good food. I had such high expectations but was sadly underwhelmed. My sister and I tried the winter pasta, hanger steak, and cream-filled chocolate cake. Of the three dishes, the only one that really stood out was the steak. It was really tender and surprisingly really tasty. The pasta was so lackluster and the presentation also wasn't very impressive. It looked like the chef just dumped it onto the plate...The chocolate cake was way too rich. It felt like I was stuffing fudge in my mouth. Service was good and the ambiance was very chill. I wouldn't really recommend their dinner since there are many other good restaurants to try out in the Calistoga/Napa area but I am curious to try their brunch menu!"
173,Cynthia R.,2017-02-12,5.0,"Had a wonderful evening at the Calistoga Kitchen. The wine selection was good. The menu items were diverse and, not over priced. The only Negative would be that they were sold out of two of the delicious menu items, bummer, but, we were dining rather late. We started with the chicory salad which was interesting and full of flavor and texture, followed by the Rabbit Pot Pie, which was a succulent stew topped with a delicious puff pastry topper. For dessert we chose the gingerbread with vanilla ice cream and Carmel sauce, yum!, and the chocolate cake with Baileys whip cream covered in a dark chocolate shell, very good. We found the wait staff excellent. A little noisy inside but, a lively crowd and a nice dining experience."
174,Robert B.,2015-04-12,2.0,"The service was awful,  the pork chop was a dry as a bone. The mimosas are $14.

14 dollars!

Weirdly, the eggs came with no yolks! 

Bizarre and expensive. Avoid at all costs.

Ps: they took the pork chops off the bill."
175,Stephanie T.,2016-07-27,5.0,"I was very happy with this meal. It was classic, simple, and delicious. I had the arugula salad , bread and butter and a glass of the house white, which was balanced and easy to drink. The arugula salad featured a tarragon sherry vinegarette (very lightly dressed), pecans, tomatoes, and pecorino romano. Like I said - simple, but perfect."
176,Katherine L.,2016-10-17,1.0,"My two daughters, my husband and I were enjoying our last day in Calistoga and decided to try a new restaurant for breakfast. We have been enjoying 4 solid days so far and feeling very relaxed and feeling ready to head home. We sat down and ordered french toast for our daughters, a side of apple bacon and scrambled eggs. We asked for an extra plate because my girls were going to share everything above. Then I ordered a cup of coffee for myself and my husband ordered a Mexican omelet. 
The food all arrived pretty fast and so did my coffee. I tried my coffee and I was so disappointed. I love coffee more than water :) and it tasted as if they ran another pot of water through the already used coffee grounds. My daughter asked the waitress, ""are the coffee beans recycled"", the waitress said, ""yes."" I really don't think she understood what my daughter was asking, nor took the time. 
Our actual waitress only came to drop off the food and never came back to refill our water glasses, which were all empty. Then she should have noticed my coffee was full and didn't drink it or at least asked if I wanted or needed a refill. At which time I would have told her that it didn't taste right. 
My husbands omelet was more of a soggy scramble with a ton of cheese. My daughters eggs were not solid, but they ate them. I told my daughters they had to eat their eggs before they ate their french toast. So they didn't complain too much on the eggs till later. The french toast they only had 3 bites of, they said the inside was ""doughy"" that wasn't cooked all the way. 
When the check came, the waitress didn't ask how everything was she just dropped off the check and kept walking. We looked at the bill and feeling frustrated out our experience and to top it all off we were also charged an additional $2 for the extra plate. At this point we were so beyond done with the restaurant we paid and left. My daughters who are 8 and 10 were extremely disappointed and so are the parents. We wanted to enjoy our last breakfast in a beautiful town and instead it left us feeling bitter and it cheapened the last day."
177,Lindsay R.,2017-07-09,4.0,"Just ate here for the first time and food was awesome! Best veggie burger I have ever have. I have to take off one star due to service. I had to ask for the condiments for my burger, which should either come with the burger, or be offered. I heard the other waitress ask and mine didn't bother to so I had to ask and wait for them. Also, could have been slightly more attentive. It wasn't very busy and my glass was empty for awhile before she came back by my table."
178,Ron G.,2015-01-26,4.0,"Attentive service, nicely displayed and delicious dishes, and a relaxed atmosphere (not loud or crowded) made for a wonderful Saturday dinner. Some of the other restaurants had what looked like identical menus to one another. We wanted a little different, and were happy to have found this little gem.

We enjoyed the bitter greens, a chicory salad softly dressed and graced with local blue cheese. My wife had the Rabbit Cacciatore, and remarked how the sauce was simmered to perfection and the rabbit was neither drowned nor overcooked. It was just like her mom would make it...delicious! I ordered the Duck Breast, which was crispy outside, tender inside, and flavorful and juicy. On a mattress of sweet potato puree and sour cherry sauce, it wasn't heavy or too rich. Neither of our dishes was overly salty, which means attention to detail. 

Wine by the glass at a reasonable price was icing on the cake. We each wanted to try different wines and had 3 glasses and still spent less than buying a whole bottle. And, because my wife was happy...so was I! Although we tried to resist it, we ended up getting a flourless chocolate cake for dessert. 

Just a nice experience overall, and I would recommend this place in a heartbeat. So I did."
179,Fred V.,2017-07-08,5.0,Just an outstanding restaurant in Calistoga.  It was a pleasure to be seated outside and we enjoyed a wonderful dining experience on the main street of historic Calistoga.  The staff was welcoming &amp; pleasant.  We were amazed at the wine list - many small boutique winery labels that you wouldn't find anywhere else.  Chef Rick came out &amp; made us feel welcome.  This was a small town dining experience that you rarely find anymore.  The food was delicious &amp; we can't wait to go back!
180,Carlitos W.,2015-05-09,5.0,"Wonderful experience. 
Rick (chef/owner) is a gracious magician. 
Corry (server) is wonderful. 
Exquisite cuisine. 
Comfortable environment."
181,Carnley P.,2015-12-02,5.0,"Delicious sandwiches, in-house smoked salmon, outside patio for dining and people watching. Staff that makes you feel at home. Aside from the farmer (although I did get the name of the farm where the lettuce was grown) every person who had a hand in creating our meal came by to chat. Will definitely return."
182,Larry H.,2015-07-13,5.0,"Thus has been about our 4th visit here. Very consistent quality, ambience, and service. Romantical!!"
183,basil p.,2016-05-27,5.0,Great food; best meal in town. Cowboy steak and pet rake sole were terrific. Service was friendly and prompt. Not cheap but really good. Outdoor patio is best spot to eat.
184,Rachel S.,2016-07-03,5.0,"This is my favorite restaurant in Calistoga!!!  Very accommodating with food allergies. 
The staff is very friendly and doesn't give you any attitude when you have to explain your allergies. I plan my trips to Calistoga around when this restaurant is open.  The food is amazing!!!  I really enjoy Solbar but I feel Calistoga Kitchen is just as amazing sometimes even more so."
185,Carla F.,2017-06-22,1.0,"I can't believe my plain old salad took 45 minutes to get to my table. My husband had finished his salad and then a pasta dish. I asked three times for my food, while everyone who'd come after us was eating. The restaurant was very loud, our waitress not happy. Left me with a not-going-there-again attitude."
186,Jeremy R.,2014-10-19,3.0,"Went for Sunday brunch and had a decent but overpriced meal.  $14 for Mimosa and $14 for a veggie burger that looked more like a piece of toast than a veggie burger. Description of it was much better than just the simple patty and bun.  Maybe add a cheese slice.  Also had the breakfast sandwich which was pretty good with delicious bacon.  Eggs tasted great and I substituted mushrooms for tomato - I suggest doing this.

The outside patio was nice and the ambience great for outside seating.

Overall I think there are better places to eat for the money."
187,Xtina W.,2015-12-26,4.0,"Really friendly atmosphere and cozy decor, with a nice garden outside. The food was fresh but hearty portions."
188,K S.,2017-02-25,5.0,"Delicious dinner in a quaint atmosphere. Everything was yummy, from the wine to the rabbit pate, venison stew to gingerbread cake. I really liked on the menu the ""buy a round of beers for the kitchen staff"" for just $15. Very nice, helpful staff and owner/chef.  Great ambiance and recommended for sure!!"
189,Karthik R.,2016-05-21,4.0,The food is very good! The people are very friendly and warm. The bread is soft and tastes great with their butter.
190,Annemarie G.,2015-12-20,5.0,"Outstanding fresh delicious food.  Great service.  Having moved to the area from San Francisco I consider myself a bit of a foodie, this restaurant is off the charts!"
191,Ben S.,2014-07-31,2.0,"To sum up our experience, the service was nice, but the food was really disappointing. J's dish, billed as a mozzarella, basil, and heirloom tomato omelet, had four small cubes of cheese on it and none apparent inside, and the tomatoes were flavorless. The potatoes requested to be well done, weren't. On the positive side, the english muffin was fresh and tasty.

My huevos rancheros were ok, but ordinary. There were no off tastes, but also no zing. 

A note for you fans of caffeine: the California Kitchen doesn't serve espresso drinks. The coffee was, again, ok, but ordinary. For reference, we're Peet's drinkers.

All in all, this wasn't a bad experience, but in no way was it a standout breakfast."
192,Liza B.,2015-02-19,4.0,"Very warm and attentive service! i could not ask for a more welcoming and relaxed dinner.  

The chicory salad was yummy and very fresh with just the right amount of local blue cheese and a lemony dressing. I'd get that again!

The scallops were very nicely cooked. They were firm and we were almost afraid they were overdone-- but they weren't and were fantastic. The green beans served with this dish were perfectly crisp-tender and full of flavor. Very fresh and delicious. Snow pea sprouts and garlic mashed potatoes were flavorful and my dining companion looked worried as I kept having yet ""another little  taste"" of the potatoes.  The 3 scallops on the plate left us wanting for more.

The lamb was quite good and served with mashed white beans which were hearty and tasty. I don't recall the vegetables but remember I liked them quite a bit.

We tried the apple crisp and the chocolate cake with an Irish cream flavored filling. The cake was kind of ho-hum. The apple crisp was better and good, but not good enough that I would order it again.

Simple foods well executed. The flavors shine and the food is fresh and delicious! And the staff... I'd come back just for the atmosphere, but the food is really good and worth coming back for."
193,Susan D.,2016-06-28,5.0,"Fabulous!  Locally grown veggie /brisket hash was to die for!  Truffled Brie omelette and yummy potatoes were also a hit. Charming, cozy, bustling and wait staff attentive. Our server brought us a delicious dessert- pineapple sorbet on a bed of coconut tapioca with lime zest- wouldn't have been my choice necessarily but we shared it and wanted more!"
194,Keri M.,2017-05-04,5.0,Incredible fish and vegetable risotto. The patio is so cute and they have an excellent wine selection if you want to go and just have a drink. Very attentive wait staff! Will return when we are back in Calistoga!
195,James M.,2015-11-11,5.0,"Lamb salad - wife said was tender and excellent light meal.  Now for the come to Jesus moment....the hamburger on a croissant bun was absolutely the best one I've eaten in my 51 yrs.  I dont know if it was prime burger now just double ground, but it melted in your mouth at medium.  They give you a 10-12 oz. patty that comes out an inch thick after cooking and as large as the bun.  Do yourself a favor, go for the hamburger and taste the way a burger should taste !  Excellent service only added to the atmosphere and eating in their courtyard was lovely."
196,Amy W.,2017-04-28,5.0,"When thinking about Napa area there seem to be many choices for dining - but this is hands down amongst the VERY best! The atmosphere is so warm and welcoming, not stuffy at all. The staff gives great service and the food is exquisite. You can tell that the owner is CIA trained - it is the best food in Calistoga. The restaurant is quaint and perfect for a romantic meal as well as a celebration. The homemade gnocchi and the roasted duck - OMG! Dessert are exceptional. Kudos... we will be back!"
197,Bridget L.,2015-11-30,5.0,"Please be aware of what kind of people are writing these 2 star reviews. This is Napa Valley, everything is fresh/farm to table so you're going to pay for it... everywhere. If you want huge portions go to Golden Corral or Dennys. I'm a local and this is one of the best places in town. Large enough portions (I can never finish mine), it takes longer because everything is made fresh and doesn't sit under a heat lamp and the menu changes to what is fresh for the season. No, it's not a place for kids but Napa Valley isn't either. No you can't get a greasy hamburger and french fries but that's not what this place is about. It's wonderful food and friendly servers. Take it from a local... one of the best places in town!"
198,Rosie T.,2014-05-10,4.0,"The food here is probably the best in the area. Snotty restaurants aside, this is the best. Too bad its only open til mid-day. Great breakfasts, meals, deserts. 
Downside - waitress not as attentive as she should have been. Chicken sausage so tiny, like cat poops.
Everything delicious though (unlike cat poop).
I would look no further than here to eat.
Fun ambiance, a might touristy - but I was a tourist!"
199,Fabi F.,2014-09-30,3.0,"I really wanted to like this place. I have walked by this location many times and I have always loved the grounds of this restored Victorian mansion. When I finally made my way inside I loved the creative home-made decorations. Everything suggested local, fresh produce and meats. They were playing old hippie man music too like the Stones and The Band which made me feel relaxed and nostalgic. 

The service was great and friendly. So why three stars? The food was bland. I could tell it was fresh and ""cooked"" well, just not seasoned well. I rarely salt my food at a restaurant, but I had to here. And still it was missing something. 

I got the Mozzarella and Heirloom Tomato Omelet which came with home fries-all under-seasoned, but like I said I could tell it was quality, just missing the ""oomph."" My friends both got the Steak Hash and said the same thing about their plates, that they were bland. I am thinking that people who are on a low-sodium diet might do well here."
200,Laura S.,2017-05-06,5.0,"We had a fantastic dinner at Calistoga kitchen last night. The server, Ingrid, was very friendly and helpful. We had salads that were delicious and a generous portion. We had the special fish which was halibut which was cooked to perfection... A fabulous evening!"
201,Ester U.,2015-06-21,1.0,"The service here is horrible, the young girl that greeted us was rude and condescending. We arrive for breakfast, expecting to just eat real quick. We ask for a table, looking around there were at least five open tables and only a couple filled up. However, the hostess said we had to wait 40 minutes. At this we were shocked considering all the open seats, we asked why and she said they all were reserved. 
Well we can't do anything about that and left our phone number, to just look around. 20 minutes pass, 30 minutes pass. We go back in and ask if there are any available seats and that we were here and left our number. The same girl now says we have to wait an hour! Well that got us mad and we left. Maybe if she was nicer and didn't try to get rid of us we would have understood the situation but she was way too rude. 
I do not recommend."
202,Shelley V.,2017-04-25,5.0,"Had Sunday brunch for six on short notice and seated in an inside semi private room - perfect! Outside patio was full and had a few heaters as it was a cool breezy day. Everything we ordered was well prepared, presented and delicious. Service, friendly and fast enough for a leisurely meal. Oh, so charming."
203,Jack I.,2015-09-09,3.0,"This is a tough one. I wanted to like it but found the food rather bland. I had Steak Hash and I didn't finish if.

Wife had the Ratatouille with fried eggs and she enjoyed hers.

Not a place for my kids. The French toast my son got was out of brioche. Just a little too high brow for my kids! Overall it was just okay."
204,Melina P.,2014-05-11,1.0,"Read my check in.  This restaurant says they are local supporters but if they don't want to keep tables available for local walk-ins, especially when the restaurant is completely empty, then forget it.  Off our list permanently!  Even if you're booked with reservations you know us!  We are literally quick diners and we tip our local community very well.  If your staff is too lazy to put the effort in to support you then hire new staff.  DONT EAT HERE IF YOU WANT TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY!

Just to update, we finished our brunch up the street and decided to walk by to see how busy this place really was... Empty. Flat empty.  Good work ostracizing your local community!"
205,Sasha H.,2016-12-30,5.0,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing meal here. We ordered the duck breast lettuce cups, and the scallops. They also had a veal risotto special that was incredible! We finished with a flourless chocolate for dessert. No complaints, amazing food and great service. Try their Grow Wines Chardonnay by the glass! Will be coming back!!"
206,Les I.,2015-06-14,5.0,Calistoga Kitchen is a cozy delightful restaurant. Perfect place for a Sunday brunch. Got there when they opened @ 9:30am and there was no wait for 2. But by 10am the place started to fill up fast. I ordered the Mexican Cowboy Omelet while dad opted for Smoked Beef Hash. Both were presented very appetizing and we did not leave hungry. Service was efficient and was constantly checked on for refills of water and coffee. A big plus in my book! Love the ambience of the restaurant and looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu in the future.
207,Julian M.,2014-04-28,5.0,"Incredible breakfast / brunch on Sunday. Great varied menu, really good service, and incredible food."
208,Michelle B.,2014-02-27,5.0,"My best friend and I were having a weekend in Calistoga and decided to try this place for Sunday brunch before heading back home. We were blown away! We had to wait for menus cause they were just printing them and we had the first reservation of the morning at 9:30am. They brought us our coffee as we waited for the fresh menus, the coffee was delicious. My friend ordered the NY strip hash and I got the Walnut french toast. The french toast looked divine with some fresh berries and a healthy portion of whipped cream and it tasted wonderful! It was the prefect portion size where I felt full but not stuffed. I tried a bite of the hash and it too tasted wonderful! I highly recommend this place, wonderful service and food. Just to mention this is a review just for their Sunday brunch."
209,Chris G.,2016-06-12,5.0,We enjoyed a delicious breakfast in a beautiful patio courtyard setting! The service was excellent. Every food item we saw delivered looked amazing g...wish we could have tried a little of everything!
210,Jeff S.,2016-01-31,5.0,"This is my new favorite breakfast place in Calistoga. The menu was effectively amazing with lots of crazy good choices to choose from. They were enthusiastic and helpful and even accommodating personal preferences. Our waiter, Scott, was very efficient, and clearly very good in the realm of hospitality. I will not miss an opportunity to eat breakfast here again."
211,Nickers S.,2013-06-06,1.0,"9:45am on a VERY quiet, sunny sleepy Sunday...6 customers in the whole place. The entire patio was wide open. There were at least 25 open seats, and 4 mobile umbrellas to provide shade. First of all they would NOT merge two tables to form a comfortable 6-top. Then, they refused to move an umbrella to give the pregnant lady of our group shade. We come from San Francisco, when we ask for a table outside its for a reason, we seek sunshine and warmth. 
Bottom line, NOT accommodating, shockingly rude and pretentious for a 'home style' appearance.

I know good customer service, I am a fifth generation Napan. I worked in fine dining restaurants for 10 years. Born and raised in the Napa Valley and  living in San Francisco for the past 8 years. Napan's have pride for original, good nature, down home kind of people. Outsiders think because they have a restaurant in the valley they can get away with a bad attitude. Perhaps they should work on their communication and accommodation skills; that is what the service industry is all about and Calistoga Kitchen needs to take the elementary course.

P.S. the inside booths feel like a hotel lobby."
212,Saar H.,2013-10-23,5.0,"So,
We were in Calistoga for a day and walked around.
Originally I came for the breakfast, but that is only on Sunday.
While walking by Rick the Chef saw us and gave us some pointers on the
breakfast places around him and the coffee joints. His info was spot on,
so we came back later for lunch.
The wine was delicious, even the glass was excellent.
I had Quail and it was the first time in many restaurants that the Quail was perfectly done and succulent usually it is dry and gamy. 
My wife had the salad which was delicious for her and she is a fussy salad eater.

All in all a great place, nice location at the corner, it is also in a house so you get a more intimate feeling.
I would definitely come back."
213,Stephanie R.,2013-09-23,4.0,"This is a great addition to Calistoga!  We had a delightful dinner, starting with the pea shoot salad.  This was fabulous!  I loved the light, Asian dressing.  Very delicate and so flavorful.  For an entree I had the hunter's stew with rabbit, served over warm polenta.  My friend had the vegetarian pasta.  I loved my stew.  It was served with greens and had a tomato base.  Very hearty and comforting.  My friend really enjoyed the pasta  as well.

Hope to be able to visit again!  Great service, loved the atmosphere, and the food was excellent!"
214,Denise L.,2015-07-12,5.0,"Steak and eggs was so good. Cooked perfectly Medium Rare. I wanted steak sauce and the chef brought me Worcestershire sauce and the house BBQ sauce. To make a long story short, I didn't really want the BBQ sauce HOWEVER! after dipping my ever so scrumptious steak in it I couldn't stop. So make sure you ask for a side of the house BBQ sauce, you'll probably want to purchase a bucket to go. :)"
215,Julian P.,2014-05-13,4.0,"Wow, the food, is amazing! I don't think I have ever cleaned the plate of every course before. 

Started with the Arugula beet salad. Cleaned that place. The Beet was very playful looking and sweet to the taste. The Arugula was very crisp and fresh. great starter.

I then had the Duck breast. Usually a bit oily, this was served perfectly. Not oily at all. also cleaned the plate.

For Desert, I had the ice cream with banana and walnuts. Delicious.

The atmosphere was nice and relaxing. Very peaceful. I would recommend this place for great food and a good environment."
216,Dave Y.,2013-10-10,5.0,"This is a real find. Rick used to do only catering, now he is open Thursday night thru Sunday Brunch. 4 of us had a great Brunch. Ribeye hash with a nice sunnyside up egg, breakfast sandwich with Model Bakery English Muffin, Huevos Rancheros, and a beautiful mushroom omelet, light as air. all great!"
217,Patti F.,2016-12-04,5.0,"Amazing brunch!  Everything delicious and friendly staff.  Gravlax salad, blt with duck egg, and warm spinach salad...yummy!"
218,Ruth L.,2013-04-14,5.0,"Had a delightful lunch at Calistoga Kitchen today.
Hadn't been to Calistoga in a while &amp; was pleased to find this corner restaurant with  charming patio seating &amp; the most delicious fresh lunch. I had a tasteful BLT sandwich, while my friend's French Toast looked better than  any I have ever seen.
Owner Rick was very friendly; will definitely go back to try the organic juices.
Ruth Livingston"
219,Connie L.,2014-01-26,4.0,"Nice decor, friendly staff, good food. The duck soup was very good, but portions were small. The omelet of the day was good too. The best dish was the duck sandwich with jalapeño cheese bread. The panna cota dessert was ok, it's like a milk pudding with raspberry jam on there."
220,Marine A.,2016-09-30,5.0,"We were in lower napa valley wine tasting and decided to stop by this place based on google recommendations and Yelp reviews. All the positive reviews do not do justice to the quality and taste of the food served here. We are very impressed with the salads, Authum vegetable dish and the beef pasta (recommended by the waiter). The taste of everything served tonight including the strawberry shortcake was incredible. We also had the opportunity to meet the head chef we live in LA and are now considering driving down for two day weekends to eat here! Such a intimate small town feel with big taste!"
221,Matt H.,2014-01-19,3.0,"Stopped by for sunday brunch. Tried the omlete and it was OK. The toast was bit on the burnt side, the waiter was decent and prompt but not the nicest guy. 

The clean, quiet, euro style cafe interior and mood is nice but the food portion was small and over-priced in my opinion.

Good place to just eat and chat perhaps but not the best breakfast place."
222,Neetika V.,2016-11-29,4.0,A nice find in Calistoga. The food was tasty and the waitresses were friendly.
223,Antoinette O.,2015-07-12,5.0,"WOW WOW WOW! My friend and I stopped in for lunch on the patio and we were totally blown away! The inside service could have been friendlier (people ""greeting"" and doing the seating) but our waiter was very nice and professional. 

I had the burger with bacon and cheese. It was without a doubt the best burger I've had in my life. My friend had the Beef Carpaccio and said it was fantastic. I love that they serve Schramsberg sparkling wine from Napa. Get it if you can.

It was great value with a lovely view, good service, and amazing food. We'll be back for sure!"
224,J H.,2015-08-18,5.0,"We ate a lot of great food while we were in Northern California.  Our lunch at Calistoga Kitchen stands out as the best.  Seriously, how could a BLT and a side salad be that good?"
225,Tom P.,2015-06-20,4.0,Excellent burger  was thick and you can tell freshly ground and hand made. Accompanying with fresh side salad . Duck soup was meaty with deep rich broth. Also had daily special Niçoise salad. Again excellent. Nice wine list. Service was excellent and made great wine recommendations for out lunch.
226,Victoria E.,2013-03-14,4.0,"it was an unusual morning. The sun was beaming down and I had just spent a relaxing weekend at Harbin Retreat. Took my 335i convertible with German license plate to the restaurant, stumbled onto it, as I had not been to Calistoga since 1998, when I had been devastatingly in love, and knew that it would not last, because I never believed you could end up with the person you love, you never do. What does it have to do with food review? You may ask. Well, not really that much except food is an expression of love. When you love food you love the people you share food with. It's more than the food it's an experience. Calistoga Kitchen was not there back then. But I remembered the street, the place that filled with roses and a quaint town with beautiful boutique stores, and neat restaurants. This was no exception to the neat and charming category. It set me back 15 years, more or less. I am no longer in my early 20s, but I still believe that the only way to end a love story is by leaving it. You must leave when you love something or someone. So I had the best meal here, when the decision is made because you know what you want, it's an easy decision. For me, it was duck hash and a healthy salad plus water. The flowers were blooming, it was the first day of the spring day light savings time, and there were a few cute couples around us, and I wanted to tell them, ""don't fall in love, just don't."" Fall in love with your food but not love with someone. It's not worth it. It was in my head, but on surface I just smiled and chatted with the wait staff as I often did. I am a very outgoing friendly person who seems to get anything and everything out of anyone, just about, except for one. But that's irrelevant to this story. Chatted with the chef about the nearby hot springs and how Harbin had also changed since I was there last in 1999. Chef said he'd go on a week day, to chill, it's not that far  you know. I told him. They were firing up a grill next to the street, chicken were being roasted. I was feeling resolved that day. I had no idea what tomorrow would bring. I had no idea the consequence of a decision, words said can not be unsaid, I had no idea then. I was still hopeful, happy and thought I could be alright. I was not and had not since be alright, but that's not relevant to you sll. The food here was fantastic, and it was the last refuge before we return to reality. Make this your final stop before you have to go home and deal with the mundane, the tragic, the irreversible and the irreconcilable. Make this memory last. It's the last beautiful sight you will remember before the world's weight fall on you."
227,Jennifer Y.,2014-04-27,4.0,"Hands down, best little restaurant on downtown Calistoga strip. The intimacy
And care for service and food quality/execution is what makes this great. Only restaurant we went to all weekend. Attention to quality and details is appreciated."
228,Eric J.,2015-05-10,5.0,Had an amazing Mother's Day Brunch with the family! Huevos Rancheros was to die for and highly recommend the Sunday Brunch!
229,Trudi S.,2016-09-11,5.0,First time at Calistoga Kitchen and we (and our dogs) loved it!  Food was amazing (husband had pork chop and I had the chilled corn soup and watermelon salad) - yummy. Staff was lovely and very much accommodated our pooches on the cute patio. Chatted with all kinds of interesting people as well - friendly atmosphere.
230,Roberta D.,2014-05-27,4.0,"Wow. SO much variance on the reviews, I'm glad I didn't see them before e stopped there...twice.
I'm guessing some diners may have had service issues in the  past, or that some folks may not realize that it's a small place and so can't always accommodate groups of walk-ins,  but from what we could tell in out two meals there over a busy holiday weekend, there certainly are no problems now. 
We had  Saturday lunch with the BEST chicken sandwich and BLT we have ever had in our  lives. Hands down. Rick the chef came over and chatted for a few minutes during a slow minute. Service was great. 
Sunday brunch, very busy, no wait for an inside  table (unlike other San Franciscans, we HATE the sun and always sit inside) but a long wait for food which we were warned about. If we'd been super anxious for our meal we would have left with no hard feelings. However - the reason this is not a 5 star review is that, if I have to wait 1/2 hr for my food, AND you are out of bread so you can;t offer me a snack to tide me over, I would hope you would comp our coffees. Not a huge gesture either way but it would have been much appreciated. 
Once the food came - we ate some of the best french toast - big thick eggy slices of Cinnamon bread - and lamb hash which neither of us had had before and was also excellent. 

Service was also great. 

This is a small place with big dreams and big ideas of how food should be. Not crazy expensive either. THIS is the kind of place we should all support, tourist and local alike."
231,Robin F.,2016-01-02,4.0,"Deeeelish! Great food, so fresh and wonderful service."
232,Jeanna H.,2015-05-26,5.0,Amazing food and excellent service. The dishes were unique and tasted heavenly. The wine service was knowledgable and satisfying. The chef even came out for a chat. A fabulous night!
233,Chris M.,2015-07-06,3.0,"Well it was a mixed bag. Went in on the recommendation of a local without reservations.
It was early and we were seated right away.  Ordered wine but they were out of Zinfandel. The Charbono was excellent however. Wife got the Halibut and I got the Lamb/pasta dish. Halibut was very good and properly cooked. The lamb was ground lamb and not seasoned very well. If it is ground lamb at least let me know in the description. It tasted like it had been reheated several times. For $26 I expect much better. Dessert was good, service was good. Get rid of the ground lamb. A stewed lamb ragout with some seasoning would work. Not bad but not great."
234,Lisa H.,2015-06-27,5.0,"Amazing! Our waiter (with his sugar skull tattoo) had the best recommendations! Had the Lobster, halibut, and lamb- were all superb! Please try the Cheesecake! Our first time in Calistoga. Thank you so much for a great evening.  Everyone was so very friendly. We will be back for sure."
235,Heather C.,2015-06-26,4.0,"Super cute, great food, limited choices. We had the lamb salad and it was delicious! Great if you don't care for a lot of options. We prefer a few more options."
236,Anne S.,2016-08-08,5.0,"This restaurant is one of the gems of Calistoga.  The owner is also the chef and obviously takes pride in his work. The menu ranges from french influence to California cuisine with ingredients that are local and fresh from the fields.  I am completely addicted to his house cured salmon, in any form - my husband switches between the beef and the rabbit, guests we have taken to Calistoga Kitchen have always been blown away by the food.  I love this place!!"
237,Kymberley T.,2015-05-24,2.0,Disappointed we ordered an my friend got the wrong  meal..an the wait was ridiculous..I ordered steak an eggs an was extremely bland..no flavor no steak sauce.probably not come back.
238,Cynthia F.,2014-05-18,5.0,"There are many great restaurants in Napa Valley, but this one is definitely on the top of my list.  The food, the service, and lovely atmosphere have always been consistent.  It comes highly recommended by many locals and rightfully so."
239,Ken N.,2014-11-22,4.0,"Very nice people here; the chef/owner Rick, is dynamite. Every dish we had was excellent in every way. Great balances of flavors, and ingredients. 'The kitchen has chops', and we agree 100%. The place to come in Calistoga."
240,Andrano C.,2014-12-13,5.0,Amazing! Went with the wild boar which was perfection.  Crab salad was just the right mix.  Finished off with chocolate cake. The chef even came out afterwards to thank us for coming in.
241,Lisa L.,2014-10-04,5.0,"We made a reservation a few days before for a Friday night. We loved the setting, the waitress was super friendly and helpful. We got a bottle of wine and didn't once touch the bottle because the waitress was so attentive. I got the chicken breast on polenta with Brussels sprouts. It was delicious. My husband had the salmon with risotto and loved it. The overall experience was fabulous."
242,Jonathan R.,2015-10-10,1.0,"I can't review on the food which is unfortunate, but I can review on the hospitality. I made a reservation on open table, I asked for a patio table. I received a response saying please let us know if you want a patio table and we may be able to accommodate you.....I already asked for a patio table.....I then received a very cold reservation conformation call which seemed to inconvenience the host and she seemed a little rude. Ok, bad days happen. We had a family emergency (death) and had to leave town early. We called and stated ""we apologize, we have a family emergency and have to cancel our reservation"" we were met with ""wait, what did you say?"" We responded with ""I have to cancel our reservation"" answered with ""ok fine, you're name? Bye."" I don't know what planet these people think they're on, maybe near the top of Calistoga, but being from the SF bay we know real top notch restaurants and hospitality and this was terrible."
243,K F.,2014-11-30,5.0,"The most awesome crab omelette, lamb hash, pork chop &amp; eggs and rabbit stew!  Such a beautiful, quaint restaurant with excellent service!  Coming back again!"
244,Emily B.,2012-06-24,5.0,"We stopped by here for breakfast after a weekend of camping at Boggs Mountain Demonstration State Forest (which has awesome mountain biking, by the way). 

We ordered the wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese omelet and the french toast with berries. The omelet was on the smaller size, but who needs a 5 egg omelet anyway? They totally skimped on the country potatoes, which was unfortunate because they were really tasty. The lack of potatoes were forgotten after the first bite of the omelet -- perfectly cooked (not dry!) with PLENTY of fillings. Seriously, it was perfect. The french toast was equally delicious, made with thickly sliced walnut bread, and the berries were nice and ripe. We pretty much licked our plates clean.

The sun-soaked patio, and friendly service, made me want to stay all day drinking mimosas.

Remember to bring cash, or your checkbook. No cards!"
245,Dave H.,2015-05-01,1.0,"Lovely Friday afternoon. Wife and I were seated at nice street-side table in the courtyard. And then ignored. After two other tables were occupied and served we complained to an apologetic manager. After the third table was occupied and served we left. NOTE: no wait person or server even acknowledged us. Walked  over to the Calistoga Hotel dined on fresh oysters, turkey brie sandwich and a wonderful Thai soup. We're not given to up-and-leaving but have no regrets here"
246,Michael S.,2015-08-23,2.0,This is the first review I have ever written on yelp. I am doing so because I was disappointed here. The food was really good. I had the baby back ribs with slaw and mac and cheese. My wife had the huevos rancheros. Both were really excellent. The problem was the service. I know it's high season and a beautiful Sunday and busy but it seemed we were constantly waiting for something. To start we were never told the specials. We overheard another waitress telling others the specials. I ate most of my meal without a drink. I had finished my iced tea waiting to order. Then when the waitress did come find out I needed a refill I had to wait for awhile again as she took care of other tables only to come back and say they were out of iced tea. So she offered me a lemonade or an orange juice. Here is the crazy part ( to me ) I said I'll have a lemonade please. Then she comes back puts a glass on the table and says we found some iced tea so we made you an Arnold Palmer. Wait no one asked me if that was ok. I wanted a lemonade at that point. I didn't ask for an Arnold Palmer. I drank it because I didn't want to wait any longer. To top all that off the bathroom was out of paper towels so you were on your own to dry off after washing your hands. I used a toilet seat protector. For the prices here I expected better. I mean this isn't McDonald's.
247,Michelle L.,2013-10-19,1.0,"We just had lunch here this afternoon and wish we went to another place. They get one star for having a nice, dog friendly patio. Our grumpy, petite, dark hair waitress could not give us a smile, information about anything on the menu or more than one word responses. We decided to play it safe and ordered burgers and salads. We requested med-rare but got well done. Our $12 blue cheese and pear salad salad had NO cheese in it and only two tiny slivers of pear AND so much salt on it that it was actually inedible.  POOR SERVICE. BAD FOOD. We are wine country locals and we really wanted to like it but, there are so many other amazing options...we wont be back."
248,Tamara C.,2015-04-25,5.0,"Food, service, ambience were all excellent. I had lamb stew and Mediterranean salad. My husband had duck breast and we shared rhubarb pie. All of it was perfect. The chef came out and inquired about how things were. No full bar but wine selection was good."
249,Stephanie M.,2014-06-07,4.0,"We had a reservation, arrived a few minutes late, but they were very nice about it. The chef warned us that they were out of the salmon, in case that was a deal breaker. That was actually one of the meals we planned on ordering, but he told us about a few of their other meals and so we decided to stay. We chose to wait a few extra minutes for an outdoor table and had a great glass of Kenefick Sauvignon Blanc. Table was ready quickly and the setting was perfect. We shared the beet salad, pork chop, and spring pasta. All were delicious, as was the bottle of Tofanelli Charbono. We thought the price we paid for what we received was right on target. The service was impeccable."
250,DS H.,2013-06-07,1.0,"Food was good but can't recommend because the service and attitude of the management stood out as amongst the worst I have experienced. 

Admittedly their computers were down the night we visited but there was no excuse for the wait times and the flippant attitude we experienced.  We also were presented with the wrong bill which resulted in confrontational phone call the following day that completely soured our experience.  They got personal and aggressive for no apparent reason.

The cap was when I overheard one of the managers imply that most of the rest of the restaurants in Calistoga were not worth visiting.  Unprofessional and untrue.  There are too many other good restaurants in Calistoga and St. Helena to put up with this."
251,charlotte c.,2014-02-16,5.0,"I just left Calistoga Kitchen and felt the need to write this review as I just had the best Huevos Rancheros...ever! I am picky about food ingredients and this was made with the best. The presentation was incredible( sorry was so excited to try it, forgot to snap photo) and it had the perfect balance of flavor. Not your typical Huevos Rancheros smothered in cheese. In fact, this was a healthier, even tastier version. You will not find a greasy plate, just the right amount of everything. My friend had the breakfast sandwich that also looked incredible.  Love this place and cannot wait to come back!"
252,Bethany K.,2014-08-12,4.0,"Food was mostly delicious, pretty good service, a little expensive.

The tomato, basil, mozzarella appetizer was really good- tasted fresh and delicious, the flavors came together well, and was visually appealing.

The summer pasta was fresh and flavorful, but it felt like there was a little too much sauce.

For dessert, my friend and I split a chocolate cake. While the cake was good, it was barely thawed and still very cold.

Service was pretty good. We were walk-ins, and the staff was friendly. It did seem to take a long time for our food to arrive."
253,Torie K.,2014-07-09,1.0,The homemade veggie burger was tasteless and bland.  The service sucked and the prices way to high.
254,Marilyn Y.,2014-04-08,2.0,"The place looked cute and befitting to the Calistoga wine country atmosphere.  The menu was rather limited, but they were decent tasting.  Their lunch menu is small and people came by to check out the menu, 90% leave after looking at it.  I enjoyed my smoked salmon on baguette.  My husband had a burger, and he said it was good.  It was super special since it is a burger."
255,Shane S.,2015-04-17,5.0,"Calistoga is a quaint little town located about 20 miles north of Napa . It's famous for the hot springs and has a small Main Street in the center of town. Calistoga kitchen is nestled on the western edge and has a large neon ""Great Food"" sign to mark the spot . The new American cuisine is absolutely fantastic . Chef Rick does some amazing things with traditional fare . We had the rabbit cacciatore with Ragu sauce on paperdelle pasta . The rabbit and pasta were   well executed and the sauce was spot on to bring out the flavor of the rabbit . We also had the skirt steak on mashed potatoes which had a fantastic mushroom Cabernet sauce . My favorite was the thick cut pork chop! Cooked to a moist perfection this dish served with butternut squash was amazing !!  They even had a calvedos apple wine sauce which again was beautiful. The servings were nicely portioned .....not a just a small thimble of a meal . The rabbit , steak , and pork  were really done fantastic with the accompanying sauces perfecting the flavors of each dish. This was a 5 star  meal on a .5 mile street. Believe the ""Great Food"" neon sign !!"
256,angie g.,2013-12-10,5.0,"Very quaint and ""homey"" restaurant. Everything tasted very fresh. The sauces, the guacamole, the orange juice - all so fresh and tasty. I had huevos rancheros and it was one of the best ever. I highly recommend this eatery if you're ever in town."
257,Carlos G.,2014-03-09,5.0,Our waitress today was a short burnet girl. Who was extremely helpful and very knowledgeable. She made some excellent recomindations..we enjoyed our meal and will be returning when we return to the valley.
258,Conner B.,2013-05-27,1.0,"My fiance and I live in the Bay Area and frequently travel to wine country for the great views and restaurant scene. We stumbled on Calistoga Kitchen and loved how inviting the patio looked so we decided to have dinner. Unfortunately, the patio was the only inviting part of the evening.

We walked inside to get a table, of which there were plenty, and were promptly ignored by the server pouring drinks behind the bar area. Once we were noticed by another server, we were seated and received stale bread and butter too cold to spread. On a positive note, we liked that the wines available were local, although none were spectacular. While waiting for our server to take our order (the same woman who ignored us when we walked in) I couldn't help but feel that I was in a dining room in a nursing home (we decided to sit inside because it was getting a bit chilly). The decor seemed nice at first, but then it just looked cheap and somewhat institutional. The fact that the servers were all wearing jeans and sneakers didn't help. 

Finally our wonderful server came to take our order. We ordered the lobster salad and the arugula salad to start, and the pasta and the duck for our mains. The lobster was rubbery and not too fresh, and the whole salad tasted overwhelmingly of tarragon. The presentation was a little dated, too. The arugula salad was OK; it had wild morels but they were gritty. The main courses only reinforced the nursing home feel. Both were garnished with the same thing - not a great sign. The pasta had good flavor but that's about  it. The duck was very disappointing for one huge reason: it came sliced! Not only do I not have a beautiful duck breast in front of me, I also can't tell if they cooked the damn thing right. 

The service is poor, the food mediocre and uninspired, and the decor is cheap. If that weren't disappointing enough we had to sit and wait for our check while listening to ANOTHER of the owner's conversations. The guy is wearing a chef coat but has been milling around the dining room annoying other patrons all night. Thankfully he didn't stop by our table (although that's kind of a problem if he's talking to everyone else). 

We paid our bill graciously and decided we won't be returning. These guys are clearly trying to be more than they are, and it shows in every aspect of the business."
259,Eileen M.,2015-01-12,3.0,"It was pretty good, but the menu selection for brunch was somewhat limited. The brisket could have been more tender and I think brisket is better served with horseradish versus coarse mustard. The burger my mate had was delicious, however. Somewhat pricey, but service was pretty decent and the ambience was bright and clean."
260,Colleen J.,2013-05-28,3.0,We did the Sunday brunch over Memorial weekend.  Food was better than average and the service seemed fine to me.  Other reviews suggested otherwise.  The sunny patio was superb for soaking up some rays and people watching.  I'm giving 3 stars instead of 4 because I felt the prices were a little high for two plates and two mimosas (came to $60 not including tip).
261,Tortuga R.,2013-02-10,5.0,"We stumbled in to perhaps the best restaurant in Calistoga and felt very lucky.   The restaurant is in a small, remodeled home and is warm and charming.  The chef made a special plate that was not on the menu to accommodate my vegan husband.  Our food was delicious.  The wine recommendation suited us perfectly.  And the service was great.   The portions are on the small side, but we were well sated and perfectly satisfied with our entire experience."
262,Karina G.,2014-03-28,5.0,"Absolutely loved the food! Every bite was as delicious as the first. We can't wait to try their Sunday brunch. The service was superb, our waiter Troy was first class! The portions were perfectly sized, we left more than satisfied!"
263,Jeferson V.,2013-05-12,1.0,"Good reviews so we drove up here. However they turned us away even though it was still supposed to be ""open"". If you close at 2:30 just say so, don't say 3 if you're going to drive people away."
264,Steve J.,2014-09-04,2.0,"For a nearly empty place, this dinner took forever. Service was awful, steak frites was mediocre. Will not be back."
265,Alex B.,2013-11-17,4.0,"Excellent rib hash covered with two eggs over easy. Potatoes were cooked to perfection. Also, shared a roasted duck soup with wild mushrooms and quinoa which was really good too. Waiter forgot our silverware, but the manager and chef were very attentive and came up a number of times to make sure everything was good."
266,Patrick L.,2015-09-24,4.0,The lamb loin and smoked salmon salad were very good.  Service was fast and friendly.
267,Matt S.,2015-11-07,4.0,"Everyone enjoyed their lunch. The smoked chicken salad was great. Duck soup was good but a little salty. Smoked salmon was excellent, smoked to perfection. The beet salad was small but with a side of chicken it was just right and very tasty. The atmosphere was relaxing but a little cold. Service was excellent. Price is on par with the quality. We would recommend Calistoga Kitchen to friends."
268,James W.,2014-06-23,5.0,"OMG. Licked our plates clean! Started with the smoked salmon salad - some of the freshest lox style smoked salmon we have ever had.  For dinner we had the Salmon - crispy skin and risotto,  Fresh Papardelle pasta with mushrooms and peas. Absolutely an excellent dinner. Service exceptional, nothing to complain about."
269,Eli L.,2013-07-06,4.0,"We ordered the burger, omelet and BLT. All really enjoyed our food, particularly the heirloom tomatoes. Great choice of wines to pair with the food. However, the service was a little slow on the day we went, but still enjoyed our experience!"
270,Nikita M.,2013-08-24,5.0,Most amazing meal that I've had in a long time. My salmon was cooked perfectly and everyone at the table loved their entrées. Our wonderful waiter thankfully humored my slightly inebriated husband as he ranted about the wine that we brought. Hopefully this will become a once a week dinner stop.
271,A B.,2013-07-31,5.0,"Recently had a wonderful experience at this lovely restaurant. After 3 days of car travel and eating out of coolers, so relieved to find this little gem, esp since we are big fans of fresh and seasonal shared plates. We were pleasantly greeted by the (owner/chef?) Rick, and sat outside on a balmy evening, surrounded by white lights and flowers. Enjoyed the grilled peppers, gazpacho, avocado salad, fresh pasta w veggies, and peach &amp; blueberry cobbler - all very light, fresh and delicious! Received wonderful and attentive service from owners and our server. One other server did seem a little cranky and above it all so perhaps that is where others hit a snag? I would definitely recommend this place."
272,Madison M.,2015-05-18,5.0,Must try the burger with fried duck egg and cheese! I will come here again the next time in Napa area. The restaurant is small and no changing table for infants in restroom but there is a patio area and the food is awesome!
273,Drew P.,2014-10-25,1.0,"The hostess was the least accomodating hostess i have ever met.  The restaurant was empty when we arrived but she refused to give us a table on the patio.  Then she stuck us in the worst table in the back corner.  I've been to libraries that have better ambiance than this restaurant.  The service was mediocre, particularly for this price point.  The menu was very limited, but the food was pretty good.  Of course you should be able to get great food for that amount of money.  Needless to say my wife and I won't be back."
274,Alice S.,2013-08-16,4.0,"Stopped here after running a half marathon. It was a busy day at the restaurant. We had to wait quite awhile to get a server, but once we ordered, the food came quickly. One member of our group had an issue with her meal, but it was remedied quickly and very well. Overall, we had a very good experience!"
275,Gary E J.,2015-04-12,5.0,Excellent brunch. French toast was two huge slices of walnut cinnamon bread smothered in fresh fruit.  Sat at the counter and were entertained by the chef.
276,JoAnn B.,2013-07-25,5.0,"Great meal!  I was looking for something lighter, and the meal was exactly what I was looking for.  The gazpacho was puréed, but still had some crunch, and the quail was yummy.  For dessert, the peach crisp was the right amount of sweet.  Great wine selection as well."
277,Joseph H.,2015-08-14,2.0,"This is an average restaurant. My dish , baby back ribs, was not special at all and cost about twice what I normally pay back home in Austin. Having to ask each time I wanted a refill of my ice tea was annoying. I asked for a little herbs to mix with my bland olive oil . It came after I was finished with my bread. She said , oh well I'll just bring you more bread. When presented with the bill, there was a charge for that 2nd bread. A restaurant that charges for a piece of bread is out of line in the spirit of hospitality. To bring a 2nd piece with a smile and then put it on the bill is out of line. Good food but average, marginal service and a less than hospitable bread policy has me not returning there. Unfortunately the owner came to our table and he was a nice personable guy and the ambiance was nice as well . It just does not overcome  the rest."
278,Tom S.,2016-07-30,5.0,"Nice outdoor patio surrounded by interesting plants and lighting, although it is loud from street traffic near entrance to downtown Calistoga.  Service was friendly and positive, although a bit casual.  Plenty of good local wines by the glass to choose among.  We started with a salmon appetizer which was delicious and enough for the three of us to share.  Wife and daughter then shared the fresh watermelon salad, while as a duck fan I had to try the roasted duck soup.  Very good, large pieces of roasty duck with plenty of vegetables.  For dinner my wife had the rabbit cacciatore, and she loved the flavor as well as not having to deal with a lot of bones as in some rabbit preparations.  Daughter enjoyed the beef bolognese fresh pappardelle pasta dish, and I had one of the biggest and best pork chops of my life.  Not cheap, but a huge bone-in chop with smoky flavor.  Dessert was also expensive, think all choices $12, but we wanted one to share and it was worth the price.  It was cheesecake with ice cream, both were either restaurant or locally made, seemed like an unlikely combination but went together well and both were delicious.  A great place for a weekend dinner in Calistoga, especially if you enjoy sitting outside and watching the Lincoln Street traffic and don't mind a little noise."
279,Molly M.,2015-06-07,5.0,"Rick from Calistoga Kitchen catered a wedding at our home in Calistoga last night and the food was just outstanding and the service impeccable.  We had quite an international crowd and everyone raved about the food--it made a perfect evening in the Napa Valley even more perfect.  And Calistoga Kitchen is always a charming place to eat, inside or outside, in Calistoga and the food is always great."
280,E M.,2013-01-30,5.0,"Great quality ingredients, well prepared food and juices."
281,Rory F.,2013-09-22,1.0,RUDE...it has been a long time since I was treated so rudely at a restaurant. I was shocked by the hostess' demeanor and asked who the owner was. When she said she was a partner I just nodded and then asked for a menu to refer to. I wanted to book a party of twenty five at a future date but I will NEVER return to this restaurant. Go next door to The Calistoga Inn..and be treated like royalty.
282,Joanne L.,2015-03-09,5.0,"We drove into town and by chance, tried Calistoga Kitchen for dinner.  After a magnificent meal which we talked about all the next day, we made a reservation for the next night as well.  Only restaurant we ate at while in Calistoga and we wouldn't have done it differently.  You will enjoy it!"
283,Blake B.,2015-03-17,4.0,"The food was excellent. It's a bit pricey but a great place to go out for a nice dinner. We shared the apple crisp for dessert and we agreed it was the best we have ever had, fantastic! Due to the cost, probably wouldn't eat regularly but certainly will go back again."
284,Pat L.,2013-03-20,5.0,"Nice food, wonderful service and good value.  Even if we lied when making the reservation and said someone in the party was a foodie and critic, I think the service would have been the same.
Limited menu means that the details are precise and to the crazies seated next to us, when the omelet is stated to have a specific mix of ingredients, it is because that is what they purchased and planned to serve, so don't get all pissy and expect ""make your own omelet"" that you might find at larger establishments.  Sheesh."
285,Kathy F.,2014-07-20,5.0,"The Calistoga Kitchen is our favorite place to have a Friday lunch date. My husband and I try to go every Friday. Without exception, always the best food as well as service! We love Rick, who is hilarious, Rhen &amp; their staff. They help keep our 45 year marriage happy!"
286,Gregory L.,2013-11-24,5.0,"This is the restaurant to go to in Calistoga. You can skip most of the other places. GREAT food, friendly service, clean and comfortably modern atmosphere."
287,Ernest C.,2013-03-24,5.0,"Trying Calistoga Kitchen for breakfast, my wife and I both ordered an omelet-of-the day.  It was absolutely excellent--an omelet with seasoned teleme cheese, mushrooms, asparagus, and peas and nuggets of potato.  The omelet was cooked perfectly without scorching nor underdone.  The potatoes were very tender with a slight scent of onion and I think a bit of lemon.  The coffee was very good and freshly brewed.  Service was very good.  The price was very reasonable for a $13 omelet."
288,Dana A.,2012-07-02,5.0,"What a lovely place!  Food was great and reasonable, service efficient  and personal and the setting on the patio delightful."
289,Mary G.,2014-08-03,3.0,"large group on 8/2/14. fish was fishy, salad was not special, 16oz steak was raw by the bone. pork was good. service is a 2 star. crammed us in to tight, slow to serve or check up. will never  return.  sorry i don't like to be the bad guy"
290,John D.,2012-07-21,5.0,"First time lunch today. Was expecting all veggie based on hearing about the healthy juices and smoothies, but ordered a special lamb burger for $11. Delicious lamb, toasted bun, goat cheese (my choice), great pickles, local tomato slices, yogurt mint side, small green salad. Partner had the house made veggie burger and really liked it.   Happy friendly staff and good place to hang out."
291,David B.,2011-04-17,5.0,"I tend to spend spring break week in the Napa Valley, particularly in Calistoga and the food and wine up there just seems to get better every year with one exception, breakfast. You only have to read the San Francisco Chronicle's annual top 100 restaurants and see how many Napa names there are on the list (French Laundry anyone?) but these places aren't going to serve you breakfast. Maybe its because after a day of wine tasting and a knockout dinner you really don't feel like it, but there has to be a reason. Now I'm not saying there aren't places to go, there are, but unfortunately most are really just a step up from Denny's (the now defunct Gordon's was an exception) and despite some long waits you will be mightily disappointed. I'm not going to name names but there are long established places on the main drags of St Helena and Calistoga to avoid. However i am delighted to report a newcomer in Calistoga that could change the game if people get to know about the Calistoga Kitchen. In the spirit of full disclosure I know the chef (Rick) through his catering gigs at various big wineries but I think its clear that he is bringing a new level of effort to what has been a throwaway meal in Napa. Getting to the food its a limited menu which is a pointer to someone caring about the ingredients but its got the classics and they are beautifully executed. I am a huge Huevos Rancheros fan and this version was not piled with salsa, cheap cheese and black beans, just 2 very tasty local eggs, some cheese, guacamole, onions, black beans under the tortilla and a little sour cream. Very tasty and I'm going back. The coffee was good, there is outdoor seating and they even have a Schramsberg mimosa for $10 for goodness sake! 

Lets try to get breakfast out of the hole its in and vote with your feet."
292,T J.,2011-02-16,5.0,"Great brunch,  I hope they keep it going.  Very low key,  excellent food and I love the duck hash.  Blueberry blintzes are great,  sandwich was awesome and no corkage!!  Great local hangout.  BTW  if you are able to hook into a supper club meal,  another fabulous experience."
