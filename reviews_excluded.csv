    ",3.0,This was my first time to Zazie's for brunch. There is a good amount of seating inside and if the weather is good the back patio area is opened. All the hype is deserved. The croissants and morning bun are celestial; the frangipani croissant especially so. The coconut tarts are memorable with the lemon meringue cake another crowd pleaser. Coffee is served in cups or bowls and strong enough to resurrect the dead.  I would definitely return here and sample more of their menu and it seems to have many options. Remember to check into with the host to put your name on the list as there tends to be a line..

There was nothing special about the food, but it wasn't necessary. Simple and good company in a nice cozy place. The service was wonderful and the server did not let a minute fly by without refilling our cups of coffees or changing our empty bottles of water. Overall, it was a nice experience and don't have any complaints!"

The Tahiti French Toast was thick and sweet, the nutty blend with banana is perfect, I didn't even need maple syrup for it. The La Mer Crab Benedict is also fabulous, I love the roasted potatoes they make here because its crunchy on the outside and well flavored. <br/><br/>Even if there is no reservations available, I think the wait isn't too bad if you have company with you."

One night we dropped in for dinner and were promptly seated at quaint and cozy garden in back. We started with the moules frites -- a dish we have a hard time saying no to anywhere we go -- and absolutely loved Zazie's take on this French staple. Creamy white sauce that clung to every mussel, delicious right down to the last dunk of bread we mopped it up with.For the main we had the Coq au Vin and as good as the moules were, the chicken outdid it. Falling off the bone, flavour soaked, simple and satisfying. We'll be back for this rustic French dish done right.Friendly service, inviting decor, and reasonable prices made our night at Zazie a last-minute treat to remember. Writing about it now has got me thinking a chilly SF night like tonight might be the perfect time to pay Zazie another visit."

The only negative part about eating at Zazie is the wait. Therefore, you either have to get there right when it opens (which can be a pretty early endeavor), or you have to be ready to wait.<br/><br/>A pro-tip for going there is that the tables outside are first come first serve.

    ",5.0,"So I read this place has one of the best brunches in SF and let me tell you, it lived up to the hype. Brought my family out here for brunch since we were planning to visit Golden Gate Park in the afternoon. Showed up at 10 and there was a huge crowd waiting to be sat. That was the first clue that the place was going to great. Probably waited close to an hour and a half to be sat but the wait was worth it. Service was prompt and courteous and we had drinks at the table in no time. I enjoyed the spritzer while my girlfriend and parents enjoyed the mimosas. We started with the seasonal coffee cake(lemon cake with meyer cream cheese topped with blueberries and a blueberry sauce) that was probably the best I've ever had hands down. My girlfriend enjoyed the Cannes egg scramble with house potatoes and toast. The eggs had crispy bacon, healthy chunks of tomatoes provencales and white cheddar cheese! The house potatoes were nice and hearty and cooked in garlic, so good! I had the Croque Madame with the arugula house salad. The Croque Madame was epic! It was a Black Forest ham sandwich served on toasted Pain de mie topped with melted gruyere and a sunny side up egg, I was in heaven. My gf and I shared the Pain de Mie French Toast that was made with orange cinnamon batter and topped with fresh fruit. Only hiccup or reservation I had was on the fresh fruit. If I was to order again, I could do without the fruit. More of a personal preference, as I don't like the fresh fruit and syrup combination so much. The French Toast was delicious but we couldn't finish everything so we had to take it to go. This brunch is worth the wait and will do it again if I'm ever entertaining friends or family in SF. Saw so many other good dishes, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Get here ASAP is you haven't tried. Happy eating and enjoy!"

But it's all part of the overall fun. And once you're in they have good food, great service and staff, great ambience. If you live in Cole valley or are just visiting, coming to zazie's is pretty much a mandatory experience.<br/><br/>The indoor area is noisy and can be a bit stuffy. Personally I prefer the back patio - on a reasonably sunny day there's no better place to chill in SF. (I'm the guy you'll see there regularly on Saturday mornings - by myself, usually in my running gear, snarfing down their pancakes while catching up on the news).<br/><br/>Yes: if you like pancakes then I strongly recommend them, particularly the  bread pudding pancakes. But they're all good. Some folks like the breakfast drinks, although personally that isn't my thing. <br/><br/>Frankly, I wouldn't call all the food 5-star. The dinner pasta can be iffy, for example (I'm picky).. However overall the food is excellent and any lack is more than made up by the charm and service. <br/><br/>The place makes for interesting overheard conversations. An eclectic and very San Francisco crowd. <br/><br/>Tip: if you want a table on weekends, get there 15 minutes before they open. Get in line and put your name on the list. Yes, I know it sounds ridiculous, but if you're much later than that you might be waiting for a long time."

I've even thought about going on the speaking circuit and educate those who find themselves in this position. <br/><br/>Well on this night something different took place. <br/><br/>Soon after my friends left a girl walks over and simply asks ""would you like to dance?""<br/><br/>Huh? What?<br/><br/>This never happens to me! NEVER! <br/><br/>I am not quite buying into this just yet and look to my left and then my right to see if maybe the future ghost of Brad Pitt is sitting next to me.

See if I care.<br/><br/>After a few dances, we walk back over to our table and to my surprise everything was still there.<br/><br/>I had to ask. ""So why did you let your girlfriend ask me to dance?""<br/><br/>The boyfriend takes a sip of his beer and says ""Oh, I hate dancing and my girlfriend really wanted to get out there"". ""And so anyway, you looked like a nice guy and thought it would be safe if I let her dance with you"".<br/><br/>Translation<br/><br/>""You are ugly and am not threatened by your appearance and there is no way you could score with my girlfriend""<br/><br/>Fair enough, and sadly very true.

    ",5.0,"Going out to breakfast/brunch is my favorite thing to do on the weekends - and Zazie is definitely a special treat. Yes, you always have to wait for at least 20 minutes to get a table, but in my opinion, it's always worth the wait. The outside area is so nice on a clear day, and they've got heat lamps to warm you up. The omlettes are fantastic, but last time I went I got the fruit/yogurt/and granola and it was SO good. They also serve your lattes in big bowls here, which I love."

    ",5.0,"YUMMMMM!  Alright, first time I went: eggplant eggs benedict...I don't really like the runny egg yoke thing that happens with poached eggs but no prob here.  The hollandaise sauce was light and smooth, eggs were perfect.  Latte (soy): to die for, didn't even need sugar and I am a sweet freak!  Second time I went: gingerbread pancakes with poached pears sprinkled with cinnamon and warmed lemon curd -GEEZE LOUISE!  I then tried these at home, just made whole wheat pancakes with a ton of pumpkin pie spice...got the lemon curd and pre-cut pear halves from Trader Joe's: SOOO EASY!  Third time I went:  I shared the same pancakes with friends and got the chocolate swirl bundt cake...one of the moistest things I have ever eaten -not just chocolate swirls in there, these are chocolate ribbons of thick goodness!!  Warmed=perfection.  EVERYTHING looks good -this is a place at which you could def live off sides alone.  Next time: I am trying the banana double stacked carmel French toast...it must be infused with something (mascarpone maybe?) and they def dollop about two scoops of French vanilla ice cream on there, with whipped cream.  Doozie!  Oh, and hot waiters?  Check!!  The one with glasses botched my order the first time and forgot my beverage.  Was I mad?  I could not have been happier to have had to bug him over and over...I HEART SF!!!"
